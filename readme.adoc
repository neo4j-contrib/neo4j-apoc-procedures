= Awesome Procedures for Neo4j {branch}.x

// tag::readme[]

== Introduction

// tag::intro[]
image::{img}/apoc.gif[float=right]

// tag::intro-text[]
Neo4j 3.x introduced the concept of user-defined procedures and functions.
Those are custom implementations of certain functionality, that can't be (easily) expressed in Cypher itself.
They are implemented in Java and can be easily deployed into your Neo4j instance, and then be called from Cypher directly.

The APOC library consists of many (about 450) procedures and functions to help with many different tasks in areas like data integration, graph algorithms or data conversion.
// end::intro-text[]

// tag::full-core[]
Starting from Neo4j 4.1.1, there are two available versions of the APOC Library:

_APOC Core_ :: battle hardened procedures and functions that don't have external dependencies or require configuration.
_APOC Full_ :: contains everything in APOC core, as well as additional procedures and functions.
// end::full-core[]

=== License

Apache License 2.0

== Installation

APOC Core ::
_APOC Core_ can be installed by moving the APOC jar file from the `$NEO4J_HOME/labs` directory to the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory and restarting Neo4j.

APOC Full ::
If you want to download and run _APOC Full_, please download the JAR from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[releases page^] and place it in the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.
For further instructions, see the https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/{branch}/installation/[installation documentation^].


// end::intro[]

== Documentation

See the link:{docs}[APOC User Guide^] for documentation of each of the major features of the library, including data import/export, graph refactoring, data conversion, and more.

All included procedures are listed in the link:{docs}/overview[overview in the documentation^] and detailed in subsequent sections.

== Feedback

// tag::feedback[]
Please provide feedback and report bugs as https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/issues[GitHub issues] or join the https://community.neo4j.com/t5/tag/apoc/tg-p[Neo4j Community Forum and ask with the APOC tag^].
// end::feedback[]

== Building the library

You can build the library by running the following commands:

----
git clone http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures
cd neo4j-apoc-procedures
./gradlew shadow
cp build/full/libs/apoc-<version>-all.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

// If you want to run embedded or use neo4j-shell on a disk store, configure your `plugins` directory in `conf/neo4j.conf` with `dbms.plugin.directory=path/to/plugins`.

A full build that also runs all tests can be run by the `./gradlew build` command.

// end::build[]
