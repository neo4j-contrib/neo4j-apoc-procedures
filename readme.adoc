= Awesome Procedures for Neo4j {branch}.x

// tag::readme[]

== Introduction

// tag::intro[]
image::{img}/apoc.gif[float=right]

// tag::intro-text[]
Neo4j 3.x introduced the concept of user-defined procedures and functions.
Those are custom implementations of certain functionality, that can't be (easily) expressed in Cypher itself.
They are implemented in Java and can be easily deployed into your Neo4j instance, and then be called from Cypher directly.

The APOC library consists of many (about 450) procedures and functions to help with many different tasks in areas like data integration, graph algorithms or data conversion.

=== "APOC" Name history

// tag::name-history-text[]
http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Apoc[Apoc^] was the technician and driver on board of the Nebuchadnezzar in the Matrix movie. He was killed by Cypher.

*APOC* was also the first bundled http://neo4j.com/blog/convenient-package-neo4j-apoc-0-1-released/[A Package Of Component^] for Neo4j in 2009.

*APOC* also stands for "Awesome Procedures On Cypher"

== Installation: With Neo4j Desktop

APOC is easily installed with http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Desktop], after creating your database just go to the "Manage" screen and the "Plugins" tab.
Then click "Install" in the APOC box and you're done.

== Calling Procedures & Functions within Cypher

// tag::usage[]
User defined *Functions* can be used in *any* expression or predicate, just like built-in functions.

*Procedures* can be called stand-alone with `CALL procedure.name();`

But you can also integrate them into your Cypher statements which makes them so much more powerful.

.Load JSON example
[source,cypher]
----
WITH 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/person.json' AS url

CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value as person

MERGE (p:Person {name:person.name})
   ON CREATE SET p.age = person.age, p.children = size(person.children)

== APOC Procedures & Functions Overview

All included procedures are listed in the link:{docs}/overview[overview in the documentation^] and detailed in subsequent sections.

=== Built in Help

// tag::help[]
image::{img}/apoc-help-apoc.jpg[width=600]


[cols="1m,5"]
|===
| call apoc.help('keyword') | lists name, description, signature, roles, based on keyword
|===

// end::help[]

== Detailed Feature Documentation

See the link:{docs}[APOC User Guide^] for documentation of each of the major features of the library, including data import/export, graph refactoring, data conversion, and more.

// tag::signature[]

== Procedure & Function Signatures

To call procedures correctly, you need to know their parameter names, types and positions.
And for YIELDing their results, you have to know the output column names and types.

INFO:The signatures are shown in error messages, if you use a procedure incorrectly.

You can see the procedures signature in the output of `CALL apoc.help("name")`

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.help("dijkstra")
----

The signature is always `name : : TYPE`, so in this case:

----
apoc.algo.dijkstra
 (startNode :: NODE?, endNode :: NODE?,
   relationshipTypesAndDirections :: STRING?, weightPropertyName :: STRING?)
:: (path :: PATH?, weight :: FLOAT?)
----

== Manual Installation: Download latest release

Since APOC relies in some places on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the *matching APOC version* for your Neo4j installaton.
Make sure that the *first two version numbers match between Neo4j and APOC*.

Go to http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/{apoc-release}[the latest release] for *Neo4j version {branch}* and download the binary jar to place into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.

You can find http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/[all releases here].

// end::install[]

== Manual Configuration

// tag::warnings[]

[WARNING]
====
Procedures that use internal APIs have to be allowed in `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` with, e.g. `+dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*+` for security reasons.

If you want to use this via docker, you need to amend `+-e NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=apoc.\\\*+` to your `docker run ...` command. 
The three backslashes are necessary to prevent wildcard expansions.

You _can_ also whitelist procedures and functions in general to be loaded using: `+dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=apoc.coll.*,apoc.load.*+`
====

// end::warnings[]

// tag::version-matrix[]
=== Version Compatibility Matrix

Since APOC relies in some places on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the right APOC version for your Neo4j installaton.

APOC uses a consistent versioning scheme: `<neo4j-version>.<apoc>` version. 
The trailing `<apoc>` part of the version number will be incremented with every apoc release.

[opts=header]
|===
|apoc version | neo4j version
| http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/4.0.0.5[4.0.0.5^] | 4.0.0 (4.0.x)
| http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/3.5.0.10[3.5.0.10^] | 3.5.14 (3.5.x)
| http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/3.4.0.4[3.4.0.6^] | 3.4.12 (3.4.x)

=== Get APOC Version

To know your current `apoc` version you can use the *function* :

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.version();
----

// tag::docker[]

=== Using APOC with the Neo4j Docker image

The https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/[Neo4j Docker image] allows to supply a volume for the `/plugins` folder. 
Download the APOC release matching your Neo4j version to local folder `plugins` and provide it as a data volume:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
mkdir plugins
pushd plugins
wget https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/download/{apoc-release}/apoc-{apoc-release}-all.jar
popd
docker run --rm -e NEO4J_AUTH=none -p 7474:7474 -v $PWD/plugins:/plugins -p 7687:7687 neo4j:{branch}
----

If you want to pass custom apoc config to your Docker instance, you can use environment variables, like here:

----
docker run \
    -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
    -v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/plugins:/plugins \
    --name neo4j-apoc \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \
    neo4j
----

====
If you want to allow APOC's procedures that use internal APIs, you need to amend `+-e NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=apoc.\\\*+` to your `docker run ...` command. 
The three backslashes are necessary to prevent wildcard expansions.
====

// end::docker[]
// tag::build[]

=== Build & install the current development branch from source

----
git clone http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures
cd neo4j-apoc-procedures
./gradlew shadow
cp build/libs/apoc-<version>-all.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

// If you want to run embedded or use neo4j-shell on a disk store, configure your `plugins` directory in `conf/neo4j.conf` with `dbms.plugin.directory=path/to/plugins`.

A full build including running the tests can be run by `./gradlew build`.

// end::build[]
