 * numberOfNodes: number of nodes present in the graph
 * beta: probability an edge will be rewired. Rewiring means that an edge is removed and replaced by another edge
 *       created from a pair chosen at random from a set of unconnected node pairs. Controls the clustering of the graph.
 *       beta = 1.0: Erdos-Renyi model

 *       0.0 &lt; beta &lt; 1.0: Fast convergence towards a random graph, but still sufficiently clustered.

 * Recommended value of beta to exploit typical (randomness &amp; clustering) properties of the W-S model: 0.4 &lt; beta &lt; 0.6
