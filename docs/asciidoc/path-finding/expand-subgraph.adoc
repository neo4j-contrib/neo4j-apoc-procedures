== Expand to subgraph

[abstract]
--
This section describes a procedure that expands a subgraph from a set of start nodes, and returns all nodes and relationships within the subgraph.
--

----
apoc.path.subgraphAll(startNode <id>Node/list, {maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, filterStartNode:true, limit:-1}) yield nodes, relationships
----

Expand to subgraph nodes reachable from the start node following relationships to max-level adhering to the label filters.
Returns the collection of nodes in the subgraph, and the collection of relationships between all subgraph nodes.

Accepts the same `config` values as in `expandConfig()`, though `uniqueness` and `minLevel` are not configurable.

The `optional` config value isn't needed, as empty lists are yielded if there are no results, so rows are never eliminated.

.Example

Expand to local subgraph (and all its relationships) within 4 traversals:

----
MATCH (user:User) WHERE user.id = 460
CALL apoc.path.subgraphAll(user, {maxLevel:4}) YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
