= User Defined Functions
:description: This chapter describes gives an overview of user defined features, and summarises the functions in the APOC Extended library.




Introduced in Neo4j 3.1.0-M10

Neo4j 3.1 brings some really neat improvements in Cypher alongside other cool features

If you used or wrote procedures in the past, you most probably came across instances where it felt quite unwieldy to call a procedure just to compute something, convert a value or provide a boolean decision. 

For example:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (v:Value {id:{id}, data:{data}})
WITH v
CALL apoc.date.format(timestamp(), "ms") YIELD value as created
SET v.created = created
----

You'd rather write it as a function:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (v:Value {id:{id}, data:{data}, created: apoc.date.format(timestamp()) })
----

Now in 3.1 that's possible, and you can also leave off the `"ms"` and use a single function name, because the `unit` and `format` parameters have a default value.

Functions are more limited than procedures: they canâ€™t execute writes or schema operations and are expected to return a single value, not a stream of values.
But this makes it also easier to write and use them.

By having information about their types, the Cypher Compiler can also check for applicability.

The signature of the procedure above changed from:

[source,java]
----
@Procedure("apoc.date.format")
public Stream<StringResult> formatDefault(@Name("time") long time, @Name("unit") String unit) {
   return Stream.of(format(time, unit, DEFAULT_FORMAT));
}
----

to the much simpler function signature (ignoring the parameter name and value annotations):

[source,java]
----
@UserFunction("apoc.date.format")
public String format(@Name("time") long time, 
                     @Name(value="unit", defaultValue="ms") String unit, 
                     @Name(value="format", defaultValue=DEFAULT_FORMAT) String format) {
   return getFormatter().format(time, unit, format);
}
----

This can then be called in the manner outlined above.

In our APOC procedure library we already converted about https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/issues/144[50 procedures into functions] from the following areas:

[options="header",cols="2a,a,2m"]
|===
| package | # of functions | example function
| date & time conversion
| 3
| apoc.date.parse("time",["unit"],["format"])


|===

You can list user defined functions with `SHOW FUNCTIONS`
