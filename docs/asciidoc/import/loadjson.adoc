This section describes procedures that can be used to import JSON data from web APIs or files.

== Load JSON

Web APIs are a huge opportunity to access and integrate data from any sources with your graph.
Most of them provide the data is JSON format.

With `apoc.load.json` we can retrieve data from URLs and turn it into map value(s) for Cypher to consume.
Cypher has support for deconstructing nested documents with dot syntax, slices, `UNWIND` etc. so it is easy to turn nested data into graphs.

Sources with multiple JSON objects (JSONL,JSON Lines) in a stream, like the https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/processing[streaming Twitter format] or the Yelp Kaggle dataset, are also supported,

== Json-Path

Most of the `apoc.load.json` and `apoc.convert.*Json` procedures and functions now accept a json-path as last argument.

The json-path uses the https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath#operators[Java implementation by Jayway] of http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/[Stefan Gössners JSON-Path]

Here is some syntax, there are more examples at the links above.

`$.store.book[0].title`

.Operators
[options="header",cols="2m,4a"]
|===
| Operator                 | Description
| $                        | The root element to query. This starts all path expressions.
| @                        | The current node being processed by a filter predicate.
| *                        | Wildcard. Available anywhere a name or numeric are required.
| ..                       | Deep scan. Available anywhere a name is required.
| .<name>                  | Dot-notated child
| ['<name>' (,'<name>')]  | Bracket-notated child or children
| [<number> (,<number>)]  | Array index or indexes
| [start:end]              | Array slice operator
| [?(<expression>)]        | Filter expression. Expression must evaluate to a boolean value.
|===

If used, this path is applied to the json and can be used to extract sub-documents and -values before handing the result to Cypher, resulting in shorter statements with complex nested JSON.

There is also a direct `apoc.json.path(json,path)` function.

To simplify the JSON URL syntax, you can configure aliases in `conf/neo4j.conf`:

----
apoc.json.myJson.url=https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf
----

----
CALL apoc.load.json('https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf')

becomes

CALL apoc.load.json('myJson')
----

The 3rd value in the `apoc.json.<alias>.url=` effectively defines an alias to be used in  `apoc.load.json('<alias>',....`

== Load JSON StackOverflow Example

There have been articles before about http://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-load-json-from-url/[loading JSON from Web-APIs like StackOverflow].

With `apoc.load.json` it's now very easy to load JSON data from any file or URL.

If the result is a JSON object is returned as a singular map.
Otherwise if it was an array is turned into a stream of maps.

The URL for retrieving the last questions and answers of the http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[neo4j tag] is this:

https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf

Now it can be used from within Cypher directly, let's first introspect the data that is returned.

.JSON data from StackOverflow
[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf" AS url
CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value
UNWIND value.items AS item
RETURN item.title, item.owner, item.creation_date, keys(item)
----

.Question authors from StackOverflow using json-path
[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf" AS url
CALL apoc.load.json(url,'$.items.owner.name') YIELD value
RETURN name, count(*);
----

Combined with the cypher query from the original blog post it's easy to create the full Neo4j graph of those entities.
We filter the original poster last, b/c deleted users have no `user_id` anymore.

.Graph data created via loading JSON from StackOverflow
[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf" AS url
CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value
UNWIND value.items AS q
MERGE (question:Question {id:q.question_id}) ON CREATE
  SET question.title = q.title, question.share_link = q.share_link, question.favorite_count = q.favorite_count

FOREACH (tagName IN q.tags | MERGE (tag:Tag {name:tagName}) MERGE (question)-[:TAGGED]->(tag))
FOREACH (a IN q.answers |
   MERGE (question)<-[:ANSWERS]-(answer:Answer {id:a.answer_id})
   MERGE (answerer:User {id:a.owner.user_id}) ON CREATE SET answerer.display_name = a.owner.display_name
   MERGE (answer)<-[:PROVIDED]-(answerer)
)
WITH * WHERE NOT q.owner.user_id IS NULL
MERGE (owner:User {id:q.owner.user_id}) ON CREATE SET owner.display_name = q.owner.display_name
MERGE (owner)-[:ASKED]->(question)
----

== Load JSON from Twitter (with additional parameters)

With `apoc.load.jsonParams` you can send additional headers or payload with your JSON GET request, e.g. for the Twitter API:

.Configure Bearer and Twitter Search Url token in `neo4j.conf`

----
apoc.static.twitter.bearer=XXXX
apoc.static.twitter.url=https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?count=100&result_type=recent&lang=en&q=
----

These values can then be retrieved using the functions described in <<static-values>>.

.Twitter Search via Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.static.getAll("twitter") yield value AS twitter
CALL apoc.load.jsonParams(twitter.url + "oscon+OR+neo4j+OR+%23oscon+OR+%40neo4j",{Authorization:"Bearer "+twitter.bearer},null) yield value
UNWIND value.statuses as status
WITH status, status.user as u, status.entities as e
RETURN status.id, status.text, u.screen_name, [t IN e.hashtags | t.text] as tags, e.symbols, [m IN e.user_mentions | m.screen_name] as mentions, [u IN e.urls | u.expanded_url] as urls
----

== GeoCoding Example

Example for reverse geocoding and determining the route from one to another location.

[source,cypher]
----
WITH
        "21 rue Paul Bellamy 44000 NANTES FRANCE" AS fromAddr,
        "125 rue du docteur guichard 49000 ANGERS FRANCE" AS toAddr

call apoc.load.json("http://www.yournavigation.org/transport.php?url=http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search&format=json&q=" + replace(fromAddr, ' ', '%20')) YIELD value AS from

WITH from, toAddr  LIMIT 1

call apoc.load.json("http://www.yournavigation.org/transport.php?url=http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search&format=json&q=" + replace(toAddr, ' ', '%20')) YIELD value AS to

CALL apoc.load.json("https://router.project-osrm.org/viaroute?instructions=true&alt=true&z=17&loc=" + from.lat + "," + from.lon + "&loc=" + to.lat + "," + to.lon ) YIELD value AS doc

UNWIND doc.route_instructions as instruction

RETURN instruction
