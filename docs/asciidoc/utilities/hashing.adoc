This section describes procedures that can be used to create a hash over nodes, relationships or the whole graph.
--

The following functions calculate hashsums over nodes, relationship or the entire graph.
It takes into account all properties, node labels and relationship types.

NOTE: The algorithm used for hashing may change between APOC versions.
So we can only compare hashing results of two entities/graphs from the same or from different graph using the *very same* apoc version.

The hashsum of a graph first calculates the hashsums for each node.
This hashsum list is ordered and for each node the hashsum for all relationships and their end node are added.
This approach provides independence of internal ids.

Optionally you can supply a list of `propertyKeys` that should be ignored on all nodes.
This is useful if you store properties (like `created=timestamp()`) that should be ignored.

| function name | description
| `apoc.hashing.fingerprint(object, <list_of_props_to_ignore>)` | calculates a md5 hashsum over the object. It deals gracefully with ordering (in case of maps), scalars, arrays.
| `apoc.hashing.fingerprinting(object, {conf})` | calculates a md5 hashsum over the object. It deals gracefully with ordering (in case of maps), scalars, arrays. Please check the `Fingerprinting configuration params` table for details
| `apoc.hashing.graph(<list_of_props_to_ignore>)` | calculates a md5 hashsum over the full graph.

.n.b you cannot combine allow & disallow list for the same entity type, this means that for nodes/rels/maps you can specify allow or disallow with lists
