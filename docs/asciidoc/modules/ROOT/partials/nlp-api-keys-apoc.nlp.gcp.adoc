We can generate an API Key that has access to the Cloud Natural Language API by going to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials^].
Once we've created a key, we can populate and execute the following command to create a parameter that contains these details.

.The following defines the `apiKey` parameter
[source,cypher]
----
:param apiKey => ("<api-key-here>")
----

Alternatively we can add these credentials to `apoc.conf` and load them using the static value storage functions.

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.static.gcp.apiKey=<api-key-here>
----


.The following retrieves GCP credentials from `apoc.conf`
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.static.getAll("gcp") AS gcp;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]

| gcp
| {apiKey: "<api-key-here>"}
