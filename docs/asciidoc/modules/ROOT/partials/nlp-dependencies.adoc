The NLP procedures have dependencies on Kotlin and client libraries that are not included in the APOC Extended library.

These dependencies are included in https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/download/{apoc-release}/apoc-nlp-dependencies-{apoc-release}-all.jar[apoc-nlp-dependencies-{apoc-release}-all.jar^], which can be downloaded from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/tag/{apoc-release}[releases page^].
Once that file is downloaded, it should be placed in the `plugins` directory and the Neo4j Server restarted.
