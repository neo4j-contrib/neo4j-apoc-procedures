The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

include::partial$createExportGraph.adoc[]

The Neo4j Browser visualization below shows the imported graph:

image::play-movies.png[]

The `apoc.export.xls.all` procedure exports the whole database to an XLS file.

The following query exports the whole database to the file `movies.xls`:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.export.xls.all("movies.xls", {});
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| file         | source                        | format | nodes | relationships | properties | time | rows | batchSize | batches | done | data
| "movies.xls" | "database: nodes(8), rels(7)" | "xls"  | 8     | 7             | 21         | 102  | 15   | 20000     | 1       | TRUE | NULL

`movies.xls` contains individual sheets for each node label and relationship type.
In this case, it contains the following sheets:

* Movie
* Person
* ACTED_IN
* DIRECTED
* PRODUCED

We can query the contents of those sheets using xref::overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.xls.adoc[].
Let's have a look at a couple of the sheets:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls("file://movies.xls", "Movie");
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| lineNo | list                                                 | map
| 0      | [0, 1999, "Welcome to the Real World", "The Matrix"] | {tagline: "Welcome to the Real World", `<nodeId>`: 0, title: "The Matrix", released: 1999}
|===

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls("file://movies.xls", "ACTED_IN");
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| lineNo | list                     | map
| 0      | [0, 1, 0, "Neo"]         | {`<startNodeId>`: 1, `<endNodeId>`: 0, `<relationshipId>`: 0, roles: "Neo"}
| 1      | [1, 2, 0, "Trinity"]     | {`<startNodeId>`: 2, `<endNodeId>`: 0, `<relationshipId>`: 1, roles: "Trinity"}
| 2      | [2, 3, 0, "Morpheus"]    | {`<startNodeId>`: 3, `<endNodeId>`: 0, `<relationshipId>`: 2, roles: "Morpheus"}
| 3      | [3, 4, 0, "Agent Smith"] | {`<startNodeId>`: 4, `<endNodeId>`: 0, `<relationshipId>`: 3, roles: "Agent Smith"}
