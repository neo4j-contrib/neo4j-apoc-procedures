The `apoc.coll.avgDuration` works similar to the `avg()` function, 
but it's not an aggregate function and takes a list of durations as an argument.
For example:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH [duration('P2DT4H1S'), duration('PT1H1S'), duration('PT1H6S'), duration('PT1H5S')] AS durations
RETURN apoc.coll.avgDuration(durations) AS value
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| PT13H45M3.25S
|===


In case of null or empty list, a `null` result will be returned:
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.coll.avgDuration([]) AS output;
----

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.coll.avgDuration(null) AS output;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| output
| null
|===

In case a non-duration list is passed, a `Type mismatch` error  will be thrown:
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.coll.avgDuration([1,2,3]) AS value;
----

.Results
|===
| Type mismatch: expected List<Duration> but was List<Integer>
|===


While in case a list with all duration values is not passed, a `TypeError` will be thrown:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.coll.avgDuration([duration('PT1H1S'),2,3]) AS output;
----

.Results
|===
| Can't coerce &#96;Long(2)&#96; to Duration
|===
