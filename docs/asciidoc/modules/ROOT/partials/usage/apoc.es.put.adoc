We can create a document with a `name` property of `John Doe` and document id of `2`, in the `customers` index, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.es.put("localhost","customers","_doc", "2", null, {
  name: "John Doe"
});
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
|  {result: "created", _shards: {total: 2, failed: 0, successful: 1}, _seq_no: 2, _index: "customers", _type: "_doc", _id: "2", _version: 1, _primary_term: 1}
|===

We can update this document to add an address, by running the following query:


[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.es.put("localhost","customers","_doc", "2", null, {
  name: "John Doe",
  address: "Buckingham Palace"
});
----
