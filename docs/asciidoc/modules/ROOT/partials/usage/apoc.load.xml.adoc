The `books.xml` file described below contains the first two books from the Microsoft Books XML file.
We'll use the smaller file in this section to simplify our examples.

We'll place this file into the `import` directory of our Neo4j instance.
Let's now write a query using the `apoc.load.xml` procedure to explore this file.

.The following query processes `books.xml` and returns the content as Cypher data structures

We get back a map representing the XML structure.
Every time an XML element is nested inside another one, it is accessible via the `.children` property.
We can write the following query to get a better understanding of what our file contains.

This time we'll pass in `true` as the 4th argument of the procedure.

[options="header"]
|===
| id      | title                                    | price
| "bk101" | "XML Developer's Guide"                  | "44.95"
| "bk110" | "Microsoft .NET: The Programming Bible"  | "36.95"
| "bk111" | "MSXML3: A Comprehensive Guide"          | "36.95"
| "bk112" | "Visual Studio 7: A Comprehensive Guide" | "49.95"

In this case we return only `id`, `title` and `prize` but we can return any other elements

We can also return just a single specific element.
For example, the following query returns the `author` of the book with `id = bg102`

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml',
  '/catalog/book[@id="bk102"]/author'
)
YIELD value as result
WITH result._text as author
RETURN author;
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
| author
| "Ralls, Kim"

=== Extracting data structures

We can turn values into a map using the `apoc.map.fromPairs` function.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call apoc.load.xml("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml")
yield value as catalog
UNWIND catalog._children as book
WITH book.id as id, [attr IN book._children WHERE attr._type IN ['author','title'] | [attr._type, attr._text]] as pairs
WITH id, apoc.map.fromPairs(pairs) AS value
RETURN id, value
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| id | value
| "bk101" | {title: "XML Developer's Guide", author: "Arciniegas, Fabio"}
| "bk102" | {title: "Midnight Rain", author: "Ralls, Kim"}
| "bk103" | {title: "Maeve Ascendant", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk104" | {title: "Oberon's Legacy", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk105" | {title: "The Sundered Grail", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk106" | {title: "Lover Birds", author: "Randall, Cynthia"}
| "bk107" | {title: "Splish Splash", author: "Thurman, Paula"}
| "bk108" | {title: "Creepy Crawlies", author: "Knorr, Stefan"}
| "bk109" | {title: "Paradox Lost", author: "Kress, Peter"}
| "bk110" | {title: "Microsoft .NET: The Programming Bible", author: "O'Brien, Tim"}
| "bk111" | {title: "MSXML3: A Comprehensive Guide", author: "O'Brien, Tim"}
| "bk112" | {title: "Visual Studio 7: A Comprehensive Guide", author: "Galos, Mike"}

And now we can cleanly access the attributes from the map.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call apoc.load.xml("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml")
yield value as catalog
UNWIND catalog._children as book
WITH book.id as id, [attr IN book._children WHERE attr._type IN ['author','title'] | [attr._type, attr._text]] as pairs
WITH id, apoc.map.fromPairs(pairs) AS value
RETURN id, value.title, value.author
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| id      | value.title                              | value.author
| "bk101" | "XML Developer's Guide"                  | "Arciniegas, Fabio"
| "bk102" | "Midnight Rain"                          | "Ralls, Kim"
| "bk103" | "Maeve Ascendant"                        | "Corets, Eva"

| "bk105" | "The Sundered Grail"                     | "Corets, Eva"
| "bk106" | "Lover Birds"                            | "Randall, Cynthia"
| "bk107" | "Splish Splash"                          | "Thurman, Paula"
| "bk108" | "Creepy Crawlies"                        | "Knorr, Stefan"
| "bk109" | "Paradox Lost"                           | "Kress, Peter"
| "bk110" | "Microsoft .NET: The Programming Bible"  | "O'Brien, Tim"
