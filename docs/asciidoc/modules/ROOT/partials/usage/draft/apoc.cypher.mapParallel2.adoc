The examples in this section are based on the following graph:


[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (day:Day)
REQUIRE day.day is UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (hour:Hour)
REQUIRE hour.id is UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (minute:Minute)
REQUIRE minute.id is UNIQUE;

UNWIND range(0, 365) AS days
MERGE (day:Day {day: datetime.truncate("day", datetime()) + duration({days: days})})
WITH day
CALL {
  WITH day
  UNWIND range(0,23) AS hourOfDay
  MERGE (hour:Hour {id: day.day + duration({hours:hourOfDay})})
  SET hour.hourOfDay = hourOfDay
  MERGE (day)-[:HOUR]->(hour)

  WITH day, hour
  CALL {
    WITH day, hour
    UNWIND range(0,59) AS minuteOfHour
    MERGE (minute:Minute {id:hour.id + duration({minutes: minuteOfHour})})
    SET minute.minuteOfHour = minuteOfHour
    MERGE (hour)-[:MINUTE]->(minute)
    RETURN count(*) AS count
  }

  RETURN count AS count2
}
RETURN day, count2;

CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (m:Minute) RETURN m",
  "UNWIND range(0, toInteger(rand() * 100)) AS event
   CREATE (e:Event {uuid: apoc.create.uuid()})
   SET e.measure = rand()
   MERGE (m)-[:EVENT]->(e)",
  {}
);
----

We can see a Neo4j visualization of this graph below:

MATCH (day:Day)-[:HOUR]->(hour)-[:MINUTE]->(minute)-[:EVENT]->(event)
RETURN day.day, sum(event.measure) AS total
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10

MATCH (day:Day)
WITH collect(day) AS days
CALL apoc.cypher.mapParallel2(
"MATCH (_)-[:HOUR]->(hour)-[:MINUTE]->(minute)-[:EVENT]->(event)
RETURN _.day as day, sum(event.measure) AS total", {}, days, 8)
YIELD value
RETURN value
LIMIT 10
