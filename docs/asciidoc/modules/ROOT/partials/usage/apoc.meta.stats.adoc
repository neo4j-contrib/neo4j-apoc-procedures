Note that the `relTypesCount` field counts unique patterns (from single label to single label)
so multi-label nodes will be counted as separate paths.
For example, with the following dataset with multiple labels `Node` and `Test`:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Node:Test)-[:REL {a: 'b'}]->(:Node {c: 'd'})<-[:REL]-(:Node:Test)
----

`relTypesCount` will be `{REL: 4}`, otherwise, without label `Test`, it would be `{REL: 2}`.
