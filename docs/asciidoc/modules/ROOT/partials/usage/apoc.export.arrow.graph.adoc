The procedure expose an Arrow file of rows with the following structure
- `<id>`: for node id
- `<labels>`: list of labels
- `<source.id>`: source node id (in case of relationship)
- `<target.id>`: target node id (in case of relationship)
- `<type>`: for relationship type
- the list of properties of nodes and relationships flattened as table

So for the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.graph.fromDB('neo4j',{}) yield graph
CALL apoc.export.arrow.graph('my_file.arrow', graph) YIELD file, source, format,
    nodes, relationships, properties,
    time, rows, batchSize,
    batches, done, data
----

We'll have an arrow file with the following columns:

- `<id>`
- `<labels>`
- `<source.id>`
- `<target.id>`
- `<type>`
- `name`
- `age`
- `male`
- `kids`
- `born`
- `place`
- `since`
- `bffSince`
