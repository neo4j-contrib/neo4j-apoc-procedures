Taken from the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/RoundingMode.html#enum.constant.summary[Java official API], these are the rounding mode options:

|===
|CEILING|Rounding mode to round towards positive infinity.
|FLOOR|Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity.
|UP|Rounding mode to round away from zero.
|DOWN|Rounding mode to round towards zero.
|HALF_EVEN|Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case, round towards the even neighbor.
|HALF_DOWN| Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round down.
|HALF_UP|Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up.
|UNNECESSARY|Rounding mode to assert that the requested operation has an exact result, hence no rounding is necessary.  In cases where rounding would occur, a `java.lang.ArithmeticException` will be thrown.

====
This function has been deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0. Use Neo4j's `round()` function, which has the same signature since Neo4j 4.2, instead.
