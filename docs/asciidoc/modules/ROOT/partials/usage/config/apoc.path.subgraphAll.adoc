The procedures support the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| minLevel | Long | -1 | the minimum number of hops in the traversal. Must be 0 or 1 if specified
| maxLevel | Long | -1 | the maximum number of hops in the traversal
| relationshipFilter | String | null | the relationship types and directions to traverse.

See <<expand-subgraph-relationship-filters>>.
| labelFilter | String | null | the node labels to traverse.

See <<expand-subgraph-label-filters>>.
| beginSequenceAtStart | Boolean | true | starts matching sequences of node labels and/or relationship types (defined in `relationshipFilter`, `labelFilter`, or `sequences`) one node away from the start node.
| bfs | Boolean | true | use Breadth First Search when traversing. Uses Depth First Search if set to `false`
| filterStartNode | Boolean | false | whether the `labelFilter` and `sequence` apply to the start node of the expansion.
| limit | Long | -1 | limit the number of paths returned. When using `bfs:true`, this has the effect of returning paths to the `n` nearest nodes with labels in the termination or end node filter, where `n` is the limit given.
If set to `true`, a `null` value is yielded whenever the expansion would normally eliminate rows due to no results.
| endNodes | List<Node> | null | only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion will continue past these nodes, if possible.
| terminatorNodes | List<Node> | null | Only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion won't continue past these nodes.
| whitelistNodes | List<Node> | null | Only these nodes are allowed in the expansion (though endNodes and terminatorNodes will also be allowed, if present).
| blacklistNodes | List<Node> | null | None of the paths returned will include these nodes.
|===

It also has the following fixed parameter:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| uniqueness | String | NODE_GLOBAL | the strategy to use when expanding relationships in a traversal.
`NODE_GLOBAL` means that a node cannot be traversed more than once.
This is what the legacy traversal framework does.
