=== Sampling

Because the count stores return an incomplete picture of the data, we have to cross check the results with the actual data to filter out false positives.

We use a subset of the data to analyze by specifying the `sample` parameter (1000 by default).

Through this parameter, for each label we split data for each node-label into batches of `(total / sample) Â± rand` 
where `total` is the total number of nodes with that label and `rand` is a number between `0` and `total / sample / 10`.

So, we pick a percentage of nodes with that label of roughly `sample / total * 100`% to check against.
We pick the first node of each batch, and we analyze the properties and the relationships.
