This procedure supports the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header, cols='1a,1a,1a,3a']
|===
| name | type |default | description
| unwindBatchSize | Integer | `5000` | the batch size of the unwind
| txBatchSize | Integer | `5000` | the batch size of the transacttion
| importIdName | String | `neo4jImportId` | the name of the property to be populated with the "id" field present into the json. For example a row `{"type":"node", "labels":["Language"], "id":"10"}`, with importIdName:`foo`, will create a node `(:User {foo: "10"})`
| nodePropertyMappings | Map | `{}` | The mapping label/property name/property type for Custom Neo4j types (point date). I.e. { User: { born: 'Point', dateOfBirth: 'Datetime' } }
| relPropertyMappings | Map | `{}` | The mapping rel type/property name/property type for Custom Neo4j types (point date). I.e. { KNOWS: { since: 'Datetime' } }
| compression | `Enum[NONE, BYTES, GZIP, BZIP2, DEFLATE, BLOCK_LZ4, FRAMED_SNAPPY]` | `null` | Allow taking binary data, either not compressed (value: `NONE`) or compressed (other values)
See the xref::overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.csv.adoc#_binary_file[Binary file example]
| cleanup | boolean | false | To remove the "id" field present into the json, if present. Note that in this way we cannot import relationship, because we leverage on "id" field to connect the nodes.
| nodePropFilter | Map<String, List<String>> | `{}` | A map with the labels as keys, and the list of property keys to filter during the import as values. 
For example `{ User: ['name', 'surname'], Another: ['foo']}` will skip the properties 'name' and 'surname' of nodes with label 'User' and the property 'foo' of (:Another) nodes. +
Note that if a node has multiple labels, in this example `(:User:Another {})`, all properties of both labels will be filtered, that is 'name', 'surname', and 'foo'. +
We can also pass a key `_all` to filter properties of all nodes, for example `{_all: ['myProp']}`
| relPropFilter | Map<String, List<String>> | `{}` | A map with the relationship types as keys, and the list of property keys to filter during the import as values.  
For example `{ MY_REL: ['foo', 'baz'] }` will skip the properties 'foo' and 'baz' of '[:MY_REL]' relationship. +
We can also pass a key `_all` to filter properties of all relationships, for example `{_all: ['myProp']}`
