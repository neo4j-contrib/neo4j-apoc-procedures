The examples in this section are based on the following file:

.$NEO4J_HOME/import/create_delete.cypher
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (n:Node {id:1});

MATCH (n:Node)
DELETE n;
----

We can run the Cypher commands in `create_delete.cypher`, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.cypher.runFile("create_delete.cypher");
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,5"]
|===
| row | fileName             | result
| -1  | create_delete.cypher | {constraintsRemoved: 0, indexesRemoved: 0, nodesCreated: 1, rows: 0, propertiesSet: 1, labelsRemoved: 0, relationshipsDeleted: 0, constraintsAdded: 0, nodesDeleted: 0, indexesAdded: 0, labelsAdded: 1, relationshipsCreated: 0, time: 0}
| -1  | create_delete.cypher | {constraintsRemoved: 0, indexesRemoved: 0, nodesCreated: 0, rows: 0, propertiesSet: 0, labelsRemoved: 0, relationshipsDeleted: 0, constraintsAdded: 0, nodesDeleted: 1, indexesAdded: 0, labelsAdded: 0, relationshipsCreated: 0, time: 0}

If we don't want to see statistics for each Cypher statement, we can set `statistics: false`:


[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.cypher.runFile("create_delete.cypher", {statistics: false});
