The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Event {name: "Event 1", date: datetime("2019-06-01")})
CREATE (:Event {name: "Event 2", date: datetime("2019-06-04")})
CREATE (:Event {name: "Event 3", date: datetime("2019-06-08")});
----

We can create a linked list of these events, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (e:Event)
WITH e ORDER BY e.date
WITH collect(e) AS events
CALL apoc.nodes.link(events, "NEXT")
RETURN count(*);
----

We can check for relationship existence using the `{avoidDuplicates: true}` configuration;
calling the previous query twice, 2 relations of type "NEXT" will be created between the nodes,
instead, by executing `CALL apoc.nodes.link(events, "NEXT", {avoidDuplicates: true})` only one relationship of type "NEXT" will be created.
