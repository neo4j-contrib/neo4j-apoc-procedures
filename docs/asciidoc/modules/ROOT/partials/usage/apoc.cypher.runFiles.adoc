The examples in this section are based on the following file:

.$NEO4J_HOME/import/create.cypher
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (n:Node {id:1});
----

.$NEO4J_HOME/import/update.cypher
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Node {id:1})
SET n.city = "London";
----

We can run the Cypher commands in `create.cypher` and `update.cypher`, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.cypher.runFiles(["create.cypher", "update.cypher"]);
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,5"]
|===
| row | fileName      | result
| -1  | create.cypher | {constraintsRemoved: 0, indexesRemoved: 0, nodesCreated: 1, rows: 0, propertiesSet: 1, labelsRemoved: 0, relationshipsDeleted: 0, constraintsAdded: 0, nodesDeleted: 0, indexesAdded: 0, labelsAdded: 1, relationshipsCreated: 0, time: 0}
| -1  | update.cypher | {constraintsRemoved: 0, indexesRemoved: 0, nodesCreated: 0, rows: 0, propertiesSet: 1, labelsRemoved: 0, relationshipsDeleted: 0, constraintsAdded: 0, nodesDeleted: 0, indexesAdded: 0, labelsAdded: 0, relationshipsCreated: 0, time: 0}

We can see the contents of the database, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Node)
RETURN n;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| n
| (:Node {city: "London", id: 1})
|===

If we don't want to see statistics for each Cypher statement, we can set `statistics: false`:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.cypher.runFiles(["create.cypher", "update.cypher"], {statistics: false});
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,5"]
|===
| row | fileName | result
