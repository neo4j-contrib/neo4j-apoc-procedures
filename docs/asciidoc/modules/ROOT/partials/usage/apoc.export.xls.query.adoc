The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

The `apoc.export.xls.query` procedure exports the results of a Cypher query to a XLS file.

The following query exports all `DIRECTED` relationships and the nodes with `Person` and `Movie` labels on either side of that relationship to the file `movies-directed.csv`:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH "MATCH path = (person:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(movie)
      RETURN person.name AS name, person.born AS born,
             movie.title AS title, movie.tagline AS tagline, movie.released AS released" AS query
CALL apoc.export.xls.query(query, "movies-directed.xls", {})
YIELD file, source, format, nodes, relationships, properties, time, rows, batchSize, batches, done, data
RETURN file, source, format, nodes, relationships, properties, time, rows, batchSize, batches, done, data;

`movies-directed.xls` contains one sheet with the name `Sheet0`.

We can query the contents of this sheet using xref::overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.xls.adoc[].
Let's have a look at a couple of the sheets:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls("file://movies-directed.xls", "Sheet0");
----

.Results
[opts="header"]

| lineNo | list                                                                       | map
| 0      | ["Lilly Wachowski", 1967, "The Matrix", "Welcome to the Real World", 1999] | {name: "Lilly Wachowski", tagline: "Welcome to the Real World", title: "The Matrix", released: 1999, born: 1967}
| 1      | ["Lana Wachowski", 1965, "The Matrix", "Welcome to the Real World", 1999]  | {name: "Lana Wachowski", tagline: "Welcome to the Real World", title: "The Matrix", released: 1999, born: 1965}
