The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (mark:Engineer {name: "Mark", city: "London"})
CREATE (jennifer:Engineer {name: "Jennifer", city: "St Louis"})
CREATE (michael:Engineer {name: "Michael", city: "Dresden"})
CREATE (jim:Engineer {name: "Jim", city: "London"})
CREATE (alistair:Engineer {name: "Alistair", city: "London"})

MERGE (jim)-[:COLLEAGUES {since: date("2006-05-01")}]->(alistair)
MERGE (mark)-[:COLLEAGUES {since: date("2018-02-01")}]->(jennifer)
MERGE (mark)-[:COLLEAGUES {since: date("2013-05-01")}]->(michael);
----

The following changes the relationship type between Jim and Alistair from `COLLEAGUES` to `FROLLEAGUES`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Engineer {name: "Jim"})-[rel]->(:Engineer {name: "Alistair"})
WITH collect(rel) AS rels
CALL apoc.refactor.rename.type("COLLEAGUES", "FROLLEAGUES", rels)
YIELD batches, total, timeTaken, committedOperations
RETURN batches, total, timeTaken, committedOperations;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| batches | total | timeTaken | committedOperations
| 1       | 1     | 0         | 1
|===

After this query has run, we'll have the following graph:
