Life restoration  of Mosasaurus hoffmanni 
Mosasaurus  is a genus  of mosasaurs , an extinct group of aquatic scaly reptiles . It lived from 
about 82 to 66 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous . Its earliest fossils were found as 
skulls near the River Meuse  ( Mosa  in Latin). In 1808, Georges Cuvier  concluded that the skulls 
belonged to a giant marine lizard with similarities to monitors  but otherwise unlike any known 
living animal, supporting the then-developing idea of extinction . Scientists continue to 
debate whether its closest living relatives are monitors or snakes . Mosasaurus  had jaws  
capable of swinging back and forth and was capable of powerful bites, using dozens of teeth 
designed for cutting prey. Its four limbs were shaped into paddles to steer underwater. 
Mosasaurus  was a predator with excellent vision but a poor sense of smell, and a high metabolic 
rate suggesting it was warm-blooded . It lived in much of the Atlantic  and in a wide range of 
oceanic climates including tropical, subtropical, temperate, and subpolar. ( Full

Note that the procedure returns empty results in case of tags without textual content, for example:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.htmlPlainText("https://en.wikipedia.org/", {meta:"meta"});
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| { "meta": "" }
|===


include::partial$html/runtime.adoc[]

For example, with the above file we can execute:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.htmlPlainText("test.html", {strong: "strong"}, {browser: "FIREFOX"});
----
.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Output
a|
[source,json]
----
{ "body": "This is a new text node " }
----
|===

If we have to parse a tag from a slow async call, we can use `wait` config to waiting for 10 second (in this example):

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.htmlPlainText("test.html", {asyncTag: "#asyncTag"}, {browser: "FIREFOX", wait: 10});
----


We can also pass an HTML string into the 1st parameter by putting as a config parameter `htmlString: true`, for example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.htmlPlainText("<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p class='firstClass'>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html>",{body:"body"}, {htmlString: true})
YIELD value
RETURN value["body"] as body
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| body
----
"
My first paragraph. 
"
----
|===


include::partial$html/query-selectors.adoc[]

For example, we can execute:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.htmlPlainText($url, {nameKey: '#idName'})
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Output
a|
[source,json]
----
{
  "h6": [
    {
      "attributes": {
        "id": "idName"
      },
      "text": "test",
      "tagName": "h6"
    }
  ]
}

== Html as json list

If, instead of a map of plain text representations,
you want to get a map of json list results,
you can use the xref::overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.html.adoc[apoc.load.html procedure], which use the same syntax, logic and config parameters as `apoc.load.htmlPlainText`.
