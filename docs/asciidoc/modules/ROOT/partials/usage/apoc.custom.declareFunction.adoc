Here is a simple example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction('answerFun() :: INT', 'RETURN 42 as answer')
----

This registers the statement as procedure `custom.answer` that you then can call.
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN custom.answerFun()
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| answer
| 42
|===

Or you can also write in this way:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction('answerFunMap() :: MAP', 'RETURN 42 as answer')
----

In this case the result is wrapped in a stream of maps called `row`. Therefore, you can do:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH custom.answerFunMap() YIELD row
RETURN row.answer
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| answer
| 42
|===

which is equivalent to deprecated one:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.asFunction('answer','RETURN 42 as answer')
----


We can create the function `custom.powers` that returns a stream of the powers of the first parameter, up to and including the power provided by the second parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareProcedure(
  'powers(input::INT, power::INT) :: (answer::INT)',
  'UNWIND range(0, $power) AS power
   RETURN $input ^ power AS answer'
);
----

We can create the function `custom.double`, that doubles the provided value, by running the following function:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction(
  'double(input::INT) :: INT',
  'RETURN $input*2 as answer'
);
----

NOTE: Function, input and output names must have at least 2 characters.

We can use this function, as shown in the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN custom.double(83) AS value;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| 166
|===

Furthermore, we can pass as a 3rd parameter a boolean (with default false) which, if true, 
in case the function returns a list of a single element, it will return only the single element itself and not the list.

For example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction('forceSingleTrue(input::ANY) :: LIST OF INT',
  'RETURN 1', 
  true
);
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| 1
|===

otherwise with false the result will be a singleton list:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction('forceSingleFalse(input::ANY) :: LIST OF INT',
  'RETURN 1',
  false
);
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| [1]
|===

Moreover, we can pass a `description` parameter as the 4th parameter,
which will be returned by the `call apoc.custom.list` and `SHOW FUNCTIONS`.
