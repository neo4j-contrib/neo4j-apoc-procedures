We can create the function `custom.double`, that doubles the provided value, by running the following function:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareFunction(
  'double(input::INT) :: INT',
  'RETURN $input*2 as answer'
);
----

NOTE: Function, input and output names must have at least 2 characters.

We can use this function, as shown in the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN custom.double(83) AS value;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value

If we don't need fine grained control over our function's signature, see xref::overview/apoc.custom/apoc.custom.asFunction.adoc[].
