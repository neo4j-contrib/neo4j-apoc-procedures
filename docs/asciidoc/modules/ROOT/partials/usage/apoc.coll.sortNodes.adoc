The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (Keanu:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves', born:1964})
CREATE (TomH:Person {name:'Tom Hanks', born:1956})
CREATE (TomT:Person {name:'Tom Tykwer', born:1965});
----

The following sorts a collection of nodes by the `name` property in descending order:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WITH collect(person) AS people
RETURN apoc.coll.sortNodes(people, 'name') AS output;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| Output
| [(:Person {name: "Tom Tykwer", born: 1965}), (:Person {name: "Tom Hanks", born: 1956}), (:Person {name: "Keanu Reeves", born: 1964})]
|===

The following sorts a collection of nodes by the `name` property in ascending order:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WITH collect(person) AS people
RETURN apoc.coll.sortNodes(people, '^name') AS output;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| Output
| [(:Person {name: "Keanu Reeves", born: 1964}), (:Person {name: "Tom Hanks", born: 1956}), (:Person {name: "Tom Tykwer", born: 1965})]
