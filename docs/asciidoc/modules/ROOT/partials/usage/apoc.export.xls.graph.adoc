The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

include::partial$createExportGraph.adoc[]

The Neo4j Browser visualization below shows the imported graph:

The `apoc.export.xls.graph` procedure exports a xref::virtual/index.adoc[virtual graph] to a CSV file or as a stream.

The examples in this section are based on a virtual graph that contains all `PRODUCED` relationships and the nodes either side of that relationship.
We can then export that virtual graph to `movies-producers.xls`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Person)-[produced:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)
WITH collect(path) AS paths
CALL apoc.graph.fromPaths(paths, "producers", {})
YIELD graph AS g
CALL apoc.export.xls.graph(g, "movies-producers.xls", {})
YIELD file, nodes, relationships, properties
RETURN file, nodes, relationships, properties;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| file                      | nodes | relationships | properties
| "movies-producers.xls" | 2     | 1             | 5
|===

`movies-producers.xls` contains individual sheets for each node label and relationship type.
In this case it contains the following sheets:

* Movie
* Person
* PRODUCED

We can query the contents of those sheets using xref::overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.xls.adoc[].
Let's have a look at a couple of the sheets:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls("file://movies-producers.xls", "Person");
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| lineNo | list                     | map
| 0      | [7, 1952, "Joel Silver"] | {name: "Joel Silver", `<nodeId>`: 7, born: 1952}
|===


[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls("file://movies-producers.xls", "PRODUCED");
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| lineNo | list                     | map
| 0      | [6, 7, 0] | {`<startNodeId>`: 7, `<endNodeId>`: 0, `<relationshipId>`: 6} 
|===
