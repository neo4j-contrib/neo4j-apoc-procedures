We can create a uniqueness constraint on `:Person(name)` and an index on `:Person(id)` by running the following query:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| label    | key    | keys     | unique | action
| "Person" | "id"   | ["id"]   | FALSE  | "CREATED"
| "Person" | "name" | ["name"] | TRUE   | "CREATED"
|===

We can drop all constraints and indexes, except for `LOOKUP`s, index constraints and multi-token indexes (because they cannot be re-created by the `apoc.schema.assert` procedure),
by running the following query:

CALL apoc.schema.assert({}, {});

.Results

| label    | key    | keys     | unique | action
| "Person" | "id"   | ["id"]   | FALSE  | "DROPPED"
| "Person" | "name" | ["name"] | TRUE   | "DROPPED"
