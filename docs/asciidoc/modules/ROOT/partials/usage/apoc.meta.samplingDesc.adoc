This procedure works by using the database statistics. A new node is returned for each label, and its connecting
relationships are calculated based on the pairing combinations of [:R]->(:N) and (:M)->[:R]. For example, for the graph
(:A)-[:R]->(:B)-[:R]->(:C), the path (:B)-[:R]->(:B) will be calculated from the combination of [:R]->(:B) and (:B)-[:R].
This procedure will post-process the data by default, removing all non-existing relationships.
This is done by scanning the nodes and their relationships.
If the relationship is not found, it is removed from the final result.
This slows down the procedure, but will produce an accurate schema.

See xref::overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.graphSample.adoc[apoc.meta.graphSample] to avoid performing any post-processing.

It is also possible to specify how many nodes and relationships to scan. The config parameter `sample` gives the skip count,
and the `maxRels` parameter gives the max number of relationships that will be checked per node.
If `sample` is set to 100, this means that every 100th node will be checked per label,
and a value of 100 for `maxRels` means that for each node read, only the first 100 relationships will be read.
Note that if these values are set, and the relationship is not found within those constraints,
it is assumed that the relationship does not exist, and this may result in false negatives.

A `sample` value higher than the number of nodes for that label will result in one node being checked.
