Let's suppose we have this data set:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {name: 'John', age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.export.arrow.stream.query('MATCH (n:User) RETURN count(n) as count, n.name as name')
YIELD value RETURN value
----

We'll have a table with the following columns:

- `count`
- `name`
