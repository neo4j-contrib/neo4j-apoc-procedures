The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'A Few Good Men', genre: 'Drama'});
----

We want to move the `genre` from the `Movie` node to a new node with the `Genre` label and `name` property.
We'll also create a `GENRE` relationship from the `Movie` node to that genre node.

This procedure requires us to create a unique constraint on the `Genre` label, `name` property, otherwise we'll get the following exception:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.refactor.categorize('genre', 'GENRE', true, "Genre", "name", [], 100);
----

.Results
[source,text]
----
Failed to invoke procedure `apoc.refactor.categorize`: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Before execute this procedure you must define an unique constraint for the label and the targetKey:
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:`Genre`) ASSERT n.`name` IS UNIQUE
----

Once we've created the constraint, we can re-run the procedure, and then see the new graph structure by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p=()-[:GENRE]->()
RETURN p;
----
