The `unique` column shows if there is an unique constraint in that specific label and property.
Similarly, the `index` column show if there is an index or not, while the `existence` looks for an existence constraint.

The `array` column check if the row is of type array and, in case `type` columns is `"RELATIONSHIP"`,
the result will be `true` if there is at least one node with 2 outgoing relationships with the type of relation given by `label` or `property` column, 
so `ACTED_IN` in the example above.

The `leftCount`, `rightCount`, `left` and `right` columns regard only rows with column `type` equals to `"RELATIONSHIP"` (otherwise they are equal to `0`)
In particular, `leftCount`, `rightCount` are "weighted" counts of respectively outgoing and incoming relationships,
which for each node will increase the count with the node's number of outgoing/incoming relationships of that type squared.
That is, if the node has 1 outgoing relationship with the provided type, the count will be increased by 1,
if it has 2 outgoing relationships, increased by 4, with 3 relationships, increased by 9, and so on.
Same thing for `rightCount`, but with incoming relationships instead.
So, with the above dataset, `(Person {name:'Keanu Reeves'})` has 5 relationships, so the count is 25,
and `(:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})` has 4 relationships, so the count is 16, this explain the total `leftCount` of 41.
Vice versa, every of the nine `(:Movie)` nodes has a single incoming relationship, so the total `rightCount`result is 9.

The `right` and `left` results are the ratio (rounded down) of respectively `rightCount` and `leftCount` to `count`.
