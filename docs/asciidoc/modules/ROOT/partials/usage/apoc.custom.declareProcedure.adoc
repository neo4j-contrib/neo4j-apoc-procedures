We can create the function `custom.powers` that returns a stream of the powers of the first parameter, up to and including the power provided by the second parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareProcedure(
  'powers(input::INT, power::INT) :: (answer::INT)',
  'UNWIND range(0, $power) AS power
   RETURN $input ^ power AS answer'
);
----

NOTE: Procedure, input and output names must have at least 2 characters.

We can use this function, to return 4°, 4¹, 4², and 4³, as shown in the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
call custom.powers(4,3);
----
