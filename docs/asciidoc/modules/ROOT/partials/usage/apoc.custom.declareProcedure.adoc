Here is a simple example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareProcedure('answerInteger() :: (row::INT)', 'RETURN 42 as answer')
----

This registers the statement as procedure `custom.answer` that you then can call.
[source,cypher]
----
CALL custom.answerInteger
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| answer
| 42
|===

Or you can also write in this way:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareProcedure('answer() :: (row::MAP)', 'RETURN 42 as answer')
----

In this case the result is wrapped in a stream of maps called `row`. Therefore, you can do:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL custom.answer() YIELD row
RETURN row.answer
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| answer
| 42
|===

which is equivalent to deprecated one:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.asProcedure('answer','RETURN 42 as answer')
----


We can create the function `custom.powers` that returns a stream of the powers of the first parameter, up to and including the power provided by the second parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.custom.declareProcedure(
  'powers(input::INT, power::INT) :: (answer::INT)',
  'UNWIND range(0, $power) AS power
   RETURN $input ^ power AS answer'
);
----

NOTE: Procedure, input and output names must have at least 2 characters.

We can use this function, to return 4°, 4¹, 4², and 4³, as shown in the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
call custom.powers(4,3);
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| answer
| 1.0
| 4.0
| 16.0
| 64.0
|===


Furthermore, we can pass as the 3rd parameter a string to specify the procedure mode (default "WRITE").
It can be:
- "READ" - if the procedure will only perform read operations against the graph
- "WRITE" - if it may perform both read and write operations against the graph
- "SCHEMA" - if it will perform operations against the schema
- "DBMS" - if it will perform system operations - i.e. not against the graph

Moreover, we can pass a `description` parameter as the 4th parameter, 
which will be returned by the `call apoc.custom.list` and `SHOW PROCEDURES`.
