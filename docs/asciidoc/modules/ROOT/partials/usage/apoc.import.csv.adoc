This procedure imports CSV files that comply with the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin-import/#import-tool-header-format/[Neo4j import tool's header format].

=== Nodes

The following file contains two people:

.persons.csv
[source,text]
----
id:ID,name:STRING
1,John
2,Jane
----

We'll place this file into the `import` directory of our Neo4j instance.

We can create two `Person` nodes with their `name` properties set, by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.csv([{fileName: 'file:/persons.csv', labels: ['Person']}], [], {});
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| file           | source | format | nodes | relationships | properties | time | rows | batchSize | batches | done | data
| "progress.csv" | "file" | "csv"  | 2     | 0             | 4          | 7    | 0    | -1        | 0       | TRUE | NULL
|===

We can check what's been imported by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| p
| (:Person {name: "John", id: "1"})
| (:Person {name: "Jane", id: "2"})
|===


=== Nodes and relationships

The following files contain nodes and relationships in CSV format:

.people-nodes.csv
[source,text]
----
:ID|name:STRING|speaks:STRING[]
1|John|en,fr
2|Jane|en,de
----

.knows-rels.csv
[source,text]
----
:START_ID|:END_ID|since:INT
1|2|2016
----

We will import  two `Person` nodes and a `KNOWS` relationship between them (with the value of the `since` property set).
The field terminators and the array delimiters are changed from the default value, and the CSVs use numeric ids.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.csv(
  [{fileName: 'file:/people-nodes.csv', labels: ['Person']}],
  [{fileName: 'file:/knows-rels.csv', type: 'KNOWS'}],
  {delimiter: '|', arrayDelimiter: ',', stringIds: false}
);
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| file           | source | format | nodes | relationships | properties | time | rows | batchSize | batches | done | data
| "progress.csv" | "file" | "csv"  | 2     | 1             | 7          | 7    | 0    | -1        | 0       | TRUE | NULL
|===

We can check what's been imported by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)
RETURN path;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| path
| (:Person {name: "John", speaks: ["en", "fr"], __csv_id: 1})-[:KNOWS {since: 2016}]->(:Person {name: "Jane", speaks: ["en", "de"], __csv_id: 2})
|===


== Binary file

You can also import a file from a binary `byte[]` (not compressed) or a compressed file (allowed compression algos are: `GZIP`, `BZIP2`, `DEFLATE`, `BLOCK_LZ4`, `FRAMED_SNAPPY`).
The binary file it can also be a string, in this case the string will be converted in byte[] using the `String.getBytes(CHARSET)` method,
where CHARSET depends on optional `binaryCharset` config (with default `UTF-8`).
Note that in this case, for both `relations` and `nodes` parameter maps, the key for the file is `data` instead of `fileName`.
For example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.csv([{data: `binaryGzipByteArray`, labels: ['Person']}], [{data: `binaryGzipByteArray`, type: 'KNOWS'}], {binary: 'GZIP'})
----

or:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.csv([{data: `file as String With ISO-8859-1 Charset`, labels: ['Person']}], 
    [{data: `file in String With ISO-8859-1 Charset`, type: 'KNOWS'}], 
    {binary: 'BYTES', binaryCharset: 'ISO-8859-1'})
