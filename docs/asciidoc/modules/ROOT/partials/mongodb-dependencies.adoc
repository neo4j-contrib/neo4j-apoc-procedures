The Mongo procedures have dependencies on a client library that is not included in the APOC Extended library.

This dependency is included in https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/download/{apoc-release}/apoc-mongodb-dependencies-{apoc-release}-all.jar[apoc-mongodb-dependencies-{apoc-release}-all.jar^], which can be downloaded from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/tag/{apoc-release}[releases page^].
Once that file is downloaded, it should be placed in the `plugins` directory and the Neo4j Server restarted.



Alternatively, you could copy these jars into the plugins directory:

* bson-3.4.2.jar
* mongo-java-driver-3.4.2.jar, 
* mongodb-driver-3.4.2.jar
* mongodb-driver-core-3.4.2.jar

You should be able to get them from the following links:

- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-driver/3.4.2[mongodb-driver]
