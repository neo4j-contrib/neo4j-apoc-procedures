By default exporting to S3 is disabled.
We can enable it by setting the following property in `apoc.conf`:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.export.file.enabled=true
----

If we try to use any of the export procedures without having first set this property, we'll get the following error message:

|===
| Failed to invoke procedure: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Export to files not enabled, please set apoc.export.file.enabled=true in your apoc.conf. 
Otherwise, if you are running in a cloud environment without filesystem access, you can use the `{stream:true}` config and null as a 'file' parameter to stream the export back to your client.
Note that the stream mode cannot be used with the apoc.export.xls.* procedures.

== Memory Requirements

To support large uploads, the S3 uploading utility may use up to 2.25 GB of memory at a time. The actual usage will depend on the size of the upload, but will use a maximum of 2.25 GB.
