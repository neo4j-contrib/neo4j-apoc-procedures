By default exporting to S3 is disabled.
We can enable it by setting the following property in `apoc.conf`:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.export.file.enabled=true
----

If we try to use any of the export procedures without having first set this property, we'll get the following error message:

|===
| Failed to invoke procedure: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Export to files not enabled, please set apoc.export.file.enabled=true in your apoc.conf. 
Otherwise, if you are running in a cloud environment without filesystem access, you can use the `{stream:true}` config and null as a 'file' parameter to stream the export back to your client.
Note that the stream mode cannot be used with the apoc.export.xls.* procedures.

== Using S3 protocol

When using the S3 protocol we need to download and copy the following jars into the plugins directory:

* aws-java-sdk-core-1.11.250.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-core/1.11.250)
* aws-java-sdk-s3-1.11.250.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-s3/1.11.250)
* httpclient-4.4.8.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient/4.5.4)
* httpcore-4.5.4.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpcore/4.4.8)
* joda-time-2.9.9.jar (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/joda-time/joda-time/2.9.9)

Once those files have been copied we'll need to restart the database.

Exporting to S3 can be done by simply replacing the file output with an S3 endpoint. The S3 URL must be in the following format:

* `s3://accessKey:secretKey[:sessionToken]@endpoint:port/bucket/key`
(where the sessionToken is optional) or
* `s3://endpoint:port/bucket/key?accessKey=accessKey&secretKey=secretKey[&sessionToken=sessionToken]`
(where the sessionToken is optional) or
* `s3://endpoint:port/bucket/key`
if the accessKey, secretKey, and the optional sessionToken are provided in the environment variables

== Memory Requirements

To support large uploads, the S3 uploading utility may use up to 2.25 GB of memory at a time. The actual usage will depend on the size of the upload, but will use a maximum of 2.25 GB.
