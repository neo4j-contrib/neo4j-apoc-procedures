Since APOC relies on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the *matching APOC version* for your Neo4j installation.

APOC uses a consistent versioning scheme: `<neo4j-version>.<apoc>` version.
The trailing `<apoc>` part of the version number will be incremented with every apoc release.

Make sure that the *first two version numbers match between Neo4j and APOC*.

Go https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[here] for all the APOC extended releases and download the binary jar to place into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.

After you move the jar file to the plugins folder you have to restart neo4j with `neo4j restart`

=== Version Compatibility Matrix

APOC uses a consistent versioning scheme: `<neo4j-version>.<apoc>` version.
The trailing `<apoc>` part of the version number will be incremented with every apoc release.

The version compatibility matrix explains the mapping between Neo4j and APOC versions:
