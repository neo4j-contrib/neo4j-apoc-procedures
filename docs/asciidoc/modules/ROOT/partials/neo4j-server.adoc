== Manual Installation: Download latest release

// tag::install[]

Since APOC relies on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the *matching APOC version* for your Neo4j installation.
Make sure that the *first two version numbers match between Neo4j and APOC*.

Go to https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[here] for all the APOC extended releases and download the binary jar to place into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.
