= Periodic Commit

Especially for graph processing it is useful to run a query repeatedly in separate transactions until it doesn't process and generates any results anymore.
So you can iterate in batches over elements that don't fulfill a condition and update them so that they do afterwards.

NOTE: as a safety net your statement used inside `apoc.periodic.commit` *must* contain a `LIMIT` clause.

The query is executed repeatedly in separate transactions until it returns 0.

   MERGE (city:City {name:user.city})
   MERGE (user)-[:LIVES_IN]->(city)
   REMOVE user.city
   RETURN count(*)",
