:description: This section describes spatial procedures and functions.



The spatial procedures enable geographic capabilities on your data, and complement the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/spatial/[spatial functions^] that come with Neo4j.
More extensive Spatial functionality can be found in the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/spatial/0.24-neo4j-3.1/index.html[Neo4j Spatial Library^].

== Geocode

The _geocode_ procedure converts a textual address into a location containing _latitude_, _longitude_ and _description_.
Despite being only a single function, together with the built-in functions _point_ and _distance_ we can achieve quite powerful results.

First, how can we use the procedure:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce('21 rue Paul Bellamy 44000 NANTES FRANCE')
YIELD location
RETURN location.latitude, location.longitude
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| location.latitude | location.longitude
| 47.2221667 | -1.5566625
|===


There are three forms of the procedure:

* geocodeOnce(address) returns zero or one result.
* geocode(address,maxResults) returns zero, one or more up to maxResults.
* reverseGeocode(latitude,longitude) returns zero or one result.

This is because the backing geocoding service (OSM, Google, OpenCage or other) might return multiple results for the same query.
GeocodeOnce() is designed to return the first, or highest ranking result.

The third procedure _reverseGeocode_ will convert a location containing _latitude_ and _longitude_ into a textual address.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.spatial.reverseGeocode(47.2221667,-1.5566625) YIELD location
RETURN location.description;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| location.description
| "21, Rue Paul Bellamy, Talensac - Pont Morand, Hauts-Pavés - Saint-Félix, Nantes, Loire-Atlantique, Pays de la Loire, France métropolitaine, 44000, France"
|===

=== Configuring Geocode

There are a few options that can be set in the apoc.conf file or via `$config` parameter (see below the `Configure via config parameter map` section) to control the service.

In the `apoc.conf` we can pass:

* apoc.spatial.geocode.provider=osm (osm, google, opencage, etc.)
* apoc.spatial.geocode.osm.throttle=5000 (ms to delay between queries to not overload OSM servers)
* apoc.spatial.geocode.google.throttle=1 (ms to delay between queries to not overload Google servers)
* apoc.spatial.geocode.google.key=xxxx (API key for google geocode access)
* apoc.spatial.geocode.google.client=xxxx (client code for google geocode access)
* apoc.spatial.geocode.google.signature=xxxx (client signature for google geocode access)

For google, you should use either a key or a combination of client and signature. Read more
about this on the google page for geocode access at
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key#key

=== Configuring Custom Geocode Provider

*Geocode*

For any provider that is not 'osm' or 'google' you get a configurable supplier that requires two
additional settings, 'url' and 'key'. The 'url' must contain the two words 'PLACE' and 'KEY'.
The 'KEY' will be replaced with the key you get from the provider when you register for the service.
The 'PLACE' will be replaced with the address to geocode when the procedure is called.

*Reverse Geocode*

The 'url' must contain the three words 'LAT', 'LNG' and 'KEY'.
The 'LAT' will be replaced with the latitude and 'LNG' will be replaced with the the longitude to reverse geocode when the procedure is called.

For example, to get the service working with OpenCage, perform the following steps:

* Register your own application key at https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/
* Once you have a key, add the following three lines to apoc.conf

----
apoc.spatial.geocode.provider=opencage
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.url=http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=PLACE&key=KEY
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.reverse.url=http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=LAT+LNG&key=KEY
----

* make sure that the 'XXXXXXX' part above is replaced with your actual key
* Restart the Neo4j server and then test the geocode procedures to see that they work
* If you are unsure if the provider is correctly configured try verify with:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.spatial.showConfig()
----


=== Configure via config parameter map 

Alternatively, we can pass a config map. + 
**Note that these configs take precedence over the `apoc.conf` settings.** +
We can pass a provider key, which will be equivalent to `apoc.spatial.geocode.provider` setting key,
and the other keys will be equivalent to `apoc.spatial.geocode.<PROVIDER>.<KEY>` settings.

For example:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce('<MY_PLACE>', {
  provider: 'opencage', 
  url: 'http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=PLACE&key=KEY',
  reverseUrl: 'http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=LAT+LNG&key=KEY',
  key: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
})
----

is equivalent to these (note that we transform `UpperCamelCase` keys in `dot.case`, e.g from `reverseUrl` to `reverse.url`):
----
apoc.spatial.geocode.provider=opencage
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.url=http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=PLACE&key=KEY
apoc.spatial.geocode.opencage.reverse.url=http://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=LAT+LNG&key=KEY
----

If we don't pass the provider via config map, the setting `apoc.spatial.geocode.provider` will be choose, otherwise the default `'osm'`. For example:

[source,cypher]
----
/* apoc.conf
  ...
  apoc.spatial.geocode.provider=google
  ...
*/
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce('<MY_PLACE>', {key: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'})
----

will pass a config like `apoc.spatial.geocode.google.key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.


== Using Geocode within a bigger Cypher query

A more complex, or useful, example which geocodes addresses found in properties of nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Place)
WHERE exists(a.address)
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce(a.address) YIELD location
RETURN location.latitude AS latitude, location.longitude AS longitude, location.description AS description
----

== Calculating distance between locations

If we wish to calculate the distance between addresses, we need to use the point() function to convert
latitude and longitude to Cyper Point types, and then use the distance() function to calculate the distance:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({latitude: 48.8582532, longitude: 2.294287}) AS eiffel
MATCH (a:Place)
WHERE exists(a.address)
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce(a.address) YIELD location
WITH location, distance(point(location), eiffel) AS distance
WHERE distance < 5000
RETURN location.description AS description, distance
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 100
----

=== sortByDistance

The second procedure enables you to sort a given collection of paths by the sum of their distance based on lat/long properties
on the nodes.

Sample data :

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (bruges:City {name:"bruges", latitude: 51.2605829, longitude: 3.0817189})
CREATE (brussels:City {name:"brussels", latitude: 50.854954, longitude: 4.3051786})
CREATE (paris:City {name:"paris", latitude: 48.8588376, longitude: 2.2773455})
CREATE (dresden:City {name:"dresden", latitude: 51.0767496, longitude: 13.6321595})
MERGE (bruges)-[:NEXT]->(brussels)
MERGE (brussels)-[:NEXT]->(dresden)
MERGE (brussels)-[:NEXT]->(paris)
MERGE (bruges)-[:NEXT]->(paris)
MERGE (paris)-[:NEXT]->(dresden)
----

Finding paths and sort them by distance

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:City {name:'bruges'}), (b:City {name:'dresden'})
MATCH p=(a)-[*]->(b)
WITH collect(p) as paths
CALL apoc.spatial.sortByDistance(paths) YIELD path, distance
RETURN path, distance
----

== Graph Refactoring

In order not to have to repeatedly geocode the same thing in multiple queries, especially
if the database will be used by many people, it might be a good idea to persist the results
in the database so that subsequent calls can use the saved results.

Geocode and persist the result

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Place)
WHERE exists(a.address) AND NOT exists(a.latitude)
WITH a LIMIT 1000
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce(a.address) YIELD location
SET a.latitude = location.latitude
SET a.longitude = location.longitude
----

Note that the above command only geocodes the first 1000 ‘Place’ nodes that have not already been geocoded.
This query can be run multiple times until all places are geocoded. Why would we want to do this?
Two good reasons:

* The geocoding service is a public service that can throttle or blacklist sites that hit the service too heavily, so controlling how much we do is useful.
* The transaction is updating the database, and it is wise not to update the database with too many things in the same transaction, to avoid using up too much memory. This trick will keep the memory usage very low.

Now make use of the results in distance queries


[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({latitude: 48.8582532, longitude: 2.294287}) AS eiffel
MATCH (a:Place)
WHERE exists(a.latitude) AND exists(a.longitude)
WITH a, distance(point(a), eiffel) AS distance
WHERE distance < 5000
RETURN a.name, distance
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 100
----

== Combined Space and Time search

Combining spatial and date-time functions can allow for more complex queries:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH point({latitude: 48.8582532, longitude: 2.294287}) AS eiffel
MATCH (e:Event)
WHERE exists(e.address) AND exists(e.datetime)
CALL apoc.spatial.geocodeOnce(e.address) YIELD location
WITH e, location,
distance(point(location), eiffel) AS distance,
            (apoc.date.parse('2016-06-01 00:00:00','h') - apoc.date.parse(e.datetime,'h'))/24.0 AS days_before_due
WHERE distance < 5000 AND days_before_due < 14 AND apoc.date.parse(e.datetime,'h') < apoc.date.parse('2016-06-01 00:00:00','h')
RETURN e.name AS event, e.datetime AS date,
location.description AS description, distance
ORDER BY distance
