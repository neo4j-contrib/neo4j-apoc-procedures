[[ttl]]
= Time To Live (TTL) - Expire Nodes
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to remove nodes from the database once a time or time limit has been reached.



Some nodes are not meant to live forever.
That's why with APOC you can specify a time by when they are removed from the database, by utilizing a schema index and an additional label.
A few procedures help with that.

[[ttl-available-procedures]]
== Available Procedures

The table below describes the available procedures:

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="5,1m,1m"]
|===
¦Qualified Name¦Type¦Release
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.ttl.expire.adoc[]
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.ttl.expireIn.adoc[]
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.ttl.config.adoc[]
|===

[[ttl-config-parameters]]
== Configuration and Parameters

For configuration, you will need to enable time-to-live functionality with the following settings in `apoc.conf`:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.ttl.enabled=true

# Optional: controls the repeat frequency
# apoc.ttl.schedule=5

# Optional: controls how many nodes are deleted in each batch
# apoc.ttl.limit=5000

----

In the available procedures listed above, there are several parameters with specific values.
The table below outlines values and formats for the valid parameters.

[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Possible Values | Examples
| `node` | The entity or entities to add the label and property of time-to-live (previous selection statement needed) | Any node or group of nodes fitting desired criteria | `n`, `person`, `group`
| `epochTime` | The datetime value of when the node(s) should expire | Any value in epoch seconds or millisecond format | `1540944000`, `1582209630000`
| `time-unit` | Measurement of units for input value | `ms, s, m, h, d` (long forms: `millis, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days`) | `milliseconds`, `h`
|===

[[ttl-examples]]
== Examples: Time-To-Live

This section includes examples showing how to use the time-to-live procedures.
These examples are based on a movies dataset, which can be imported by running the following Cypher query:

include::partial$createExportGraph.adoc[]

The Neo4j Browser visualization below shows the imported graph:

[[ttl-expireAt]]
=== Expire node(s) at specified time

The `apoc.ttl.expire` procedure deletes a node or group of nodes after the datetime specified.

To remove a single node or set of nodes, we can use a selection query prior to calling the procedure that defines which nodes we want to apply the time-to-live label and property.
We then call the procedure and pass in the selected node(s), the future datetime at which we want the nodes to be removed, and the specificity of the datetime (seconds, milliseconds, etc).

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[produced:PRODUCED]-(person:Person)
CALL apoc.ttl.expire(person,1585176720,'s')
RETURN movie, produced, person
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| "movie" | "produced" | "person"
| {"title":"The Matrix","tagline":"Welcome to the Real World","released":1999} | {} | {"name":"Joel Silver","ttl":1585176720000,"born":1952}
|===

After the point in time specified (in this case, after `2020-03-25 17:52:00`), the node(s) will be expired and deleted from the graph.
Running the statement below will return no results for our example graph.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[produced:PRODUCED]-(person:Person)
RETURN movie, produced, person
----

[[ttl-expireIn]]
=== Expire node(s) after specified time period

The `apoc.ttl.expireIn` procedure deletes a node or group of nodes after the length of time specified.
//LEFT OFF HERE!
Just as with the similar procedure above, we can use a selection query prior to calling the procedure that defines which nodes we want to apply the time-to-live label and property.
We then call the procedure and pass in the selected node(s), the time delta from current time at which we want the nodes to be removed, and the specificity of the time amount (seconds, milliseconds, etc).

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[directed:DIRECTED]-(person:Person)
CALL apoc.ttl.expireIn(person,120,'s')
RETURN movie, directed, person
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| "movie" | "directed" | "person"
| {"title":"The Matrix","tagline":"Welcome to the Real World","released":1999} | {} | {"name":"Lana Wachowski","ttl":1618008344450,"born":1965}
| {"title":"The Matrix","tagline":"Welcome to the Real World","released":1999} | {} | {"name":"Lilly Wachowski","ttl":1618008344450,"born":1967}
|===

After the length of time specified has passed (in this case, after `120 seconds`), the node(s) will be expired and deleted from the graph.
Running the statement below will return no results for our example graph.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[directed:DIRECTED]-(person:Person)
RETURN movie, directed, person
----

[[ttl-process]]
== Manual Process: How TTL Works

You can also do the time-to-live process manually by running the following steps:

* Set the `:TTL` label and `ttl` property on the node(s) you want to expire.

[source,cypher]
----
SET n:TTL
SET n.ttl = timestamp() + 3600
----

The `ttl` property holds the *time when the node is expired in milliseconds since epoch*.

* Create an index on the time-to-live label and property.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX FOR (n:TTL) ON (n.ttl)
----

When using the procedure, the index is created 30 seconds after startup/new database created.

* Remove node(s) that have passed the expiration time or length of time

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:TTL) where t.ttl < timestamp() WITH t LIMIT 1000 DETACH DELETE t
----

When using the procedure, the deletion statement to remove nodes past expiration will run every 60 seconds.
You can also configure the schedule by adding the following setting in `apoc.conf`:


.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
# Optional: controls the repeat frequency
apoc.ttl.schedule=120
----
