== Example Usage

The example below will help us learn how to use this procedure.

.The following creates a graph containing two nodes connected by a relationship:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Foo)-[rel:FOOBAR]->(b:Bar)
----

image::apoc.refactor.setType.dataset.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

.The following changes the relationship type from `FOOBAR` to `NEW-TYPE`
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Foo)-[rel:FOOBAR]->(b:Bar)
CALL apoc.refactor.setType(rel, 'NEW-TYPE')
YIELD input, output
RETURN input, output
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:
