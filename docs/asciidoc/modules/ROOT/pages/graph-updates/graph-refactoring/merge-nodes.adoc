:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to merge nodes.



We can merge a list of nodes onto the first one in the list.
All relationships are merged onto that node too.
We can specify the merge behavior for properties globally and/or individually.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH p ORDER BY p.created DESC // newest one first
WITH p.email AS email, collect(p) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes, {properties: {
    name:'discard',
    age:'overwrite',
    kids:'combine',
    `addr.*`: 'overwrite',
    `.*`: 'discard'
}})
YIELD node
RETURN node
----

Below are the config options for this procedure:
These config option also works for `apoc.refactor.mergeRelationships([rels],{config})`.

[opts=header]
|===
| type | operations
| discard | the property from the first node will remain if already set, otherwise the first property in list will be written
| overwrite / override | last property in list wins
| combine | if there is only one property in list, it will be set / kept as single property otherwise create an array, tries to coerce values
|===

In addition, mergeNodes supports the following config properties:

[opts=header]
|===
| type | operations
| mergeRels | true/false: give the possibility to merge relationships with same type and direction.
| produceSelfRel | true/false: if `true` (default), any eventual new self-relationship that would be created from the nodes merged into target node are inserted, otherwise not.
    Please note that this param is independent from `mergeRels` config and doesn't affect on pre-existing self-relationships (in this case it is used the `preserveExistingSelfRels` config).
| preserveExistingSelfRels | true/false: is valid only with `mergeRels:true`. If `true` (default), the pre-existing self-relationships in the final node will remain, otherwise will be deleted.
| singleElementAsArray | false/true: if is `false` (default) and `type` is `combine` in case the merge of two arrays is a new array with size 1 it extracts the single value.
|===

Relationships properties are managed with the same nodes' method, if properties parameter isn't set relationships properties are combined.

//If relationships have same start and end nodes will be merged into one, and properties managed by the properties config.
//If relationships have different start/end nodes (related to direction), relationships will be maintained and properties will be combine in all relationship.

== Example Usage

The examples below will help us learn how to use these procedures.

=== Same start and end nodes

.The following creates a graph containings relationships that have the same start and end nodes

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),

(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR {since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR {since:2018}]->(n3),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ {since:2004}]->(n7),
(n1)-[:DRIVE {since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS {since:2013}]->(n6);
return *;
----

.The following merges John and Tom into a single node:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{properties:"combine", mergeRels:true})
YIELD node
RETURN count(*)
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

Since we have relationships with same start and end nodes, relationships are merged and properties are combined.


=== Different start and end nodes

.The following creates a graph containings relationships that have different start or end nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
Create (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n4:Company {name:'Company2'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),
(n8:City {name:'Liverpool'}),
(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2018}]->(n4),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2004}]->(n7),
(n4)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2007}]->(n8),
(n1)-[:DRIVE{since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS{since:2013}]->(n6)
return *;
----

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.createDataSetSecondExample.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

.The following merges John and Tom into a single node:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{
    properties:"combine",
    mergeRels:true
})
YIELD node
RETURN count(*)
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExample.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExampleData.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

Since we have relationships with different end nodes, all relationships and properties are maintained.
