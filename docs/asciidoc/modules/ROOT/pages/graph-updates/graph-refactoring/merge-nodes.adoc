:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to merge nodes.



We can merge a list of nodes onto the first one in the list.
All relationships are merged onto that node too.
We can specify the merge behavior for properties globally and/or individually.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH p ORDER BY p.created DESC // newest one first
WITH p.email AS email, collect(p) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes, {properties: {
    name:'discard',
    age:'overwrite',
    kids:'combine',
    `addr.*`: 'overwrite',
    `.*`: 'discard'
}})
YIELD node
RETURN node
----

Below are the config options for this procedure:
These config option also works for `apoc.refactor.mergeRelationships([rels],{config})`.

[opts=header]
|===
| type | operations
| discard | the property from the first node will remain if already set, otherwise the first property in list will be written
| overwrite / override |Â last property in list wins
| combine | if there is only one property in list, it will be set / kept as single property otherwise create an array, tries to coerce values
|===

In addition, mergeNodes supports the following config properties:

[opts=header]
|===
| type | operations
| mergeRels | true/false: give the possibility to merge relationships with same type and direction.
| produceSelfRel | true/false: if `true` (default), any eventual new self-relationship that would be created from the nodes merged into target node are inserted, otherwise not.
    Please note that this param is independent from `mergeRels` config and doesn't affect on pre-existing self-relationships (in this case it is used the `preserveExistingSelfRels` config).
| preserveExistingSelfRels | true/false: is valid only with `mergeRels:true`. If `true` (default), the pre-existing self-relationships in the final node will remain, otherwise will be deleted.
| singleElementAsArray | false/true: if is `false` (default) and `type` is `combine` in case the merge of two arrays is a new array with size 1 it extracts the single value.
|===

If properties parameter is a map, properties with a name not included in parameter map are overridden.

Relationships properties are managed with the same nodes' method,
except when the properties parameter is null, in this case entity properties are combined.


//If relationships have same start and end nodes will be merged into one, and properties managed by the properties config.
//If relationships have different start/end nodes (related to direction), relationships will be maintained and properties will be combine in all relationship.

== Example Usage

The examples below will help us learn how to use these procedures.

=== Same start and end nodes

.The following creates a graph containings relationships that have the same start and end nodes

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),

(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR {since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR {since:2018}]->(n3),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ {since:2004}]->(n7),
(n1)-[:DRIVE {since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS {since:2013}]->(n6);
return *;
----

.The following merges John and Tom into a single node:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{properties:"combine", mergeRels:true})
YIELD node
RETURN count(*)
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

Since we have relationships with same start and end nodes, relationships are merged and properties are combined.


=== Different start and end nodes

.The following creates a graph containings relationships that have different start or end nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
Create (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n4:Company {name:'Company2'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),
(n8:City {name:'Liverpool'}),
(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2018}]->(n4),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2004}]->(n7),
(n4)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2007}]->(n8),
(n1)-[:DRIVE{since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS{since:2013}]->(n6)
return *;
----

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.createDataSetSecondExample.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

.The following merges John and Tom into a single node:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{
    properties:"combine",
    mergeRels:true
})
YIELD node
RETURN count(*)
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExample.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

image::apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExampleData.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

Since we have relationships with different end nodes, all relationships and properties are maintained.
