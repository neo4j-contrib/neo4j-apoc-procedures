== Example Usage

The example below will help us learn how to use this procedure.


.The following creates a graph containing nodes with boolean properties representented in different formats:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Person {prop: 'Y', name:'A'}),
       (:Person {prop: 'Yes', name:'B'}),
       (:Person {prop: 'NO', name:'C'}),
       (:Person {prop: 'X', name:'D'})
----

We want to transform some properties into a boolean, `Y`, `Yes` into true and the properties `NO` into false.
The other properties that don't match these possibilities will be set as `null`.

.The following normalizes all applicable boolean values for all nodes that have the `prop` property:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(n,'prop',['Y','Yes'],['NO'])
WITH n
ORDER BY n.id
RETURN n.prop AS prop
----

If we execute this query, we'll see the following result:
