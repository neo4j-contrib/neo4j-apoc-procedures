== Example Usage

The examples below will help us learn how to use these procedures.

=== Clone nodes only

.The following creates a graph with two nodes, Foo and Bar:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Foo{name:'Foo'}),(b:Bar{name:'Bar'})
----

image::apoc.refactor.cloneNodes.dataset.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

.The following creates copies of both of these nodes:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Foo{name:'Foo'}),(b:Bar{name:'Bar'})
CALL apoc.refactor.cloneNodes([f,b])
YIELD input, output
RETURN *
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

=== Clone nodes with relationships

.The following creates a graph containing two different nodes of type `Actor` connected with other two different node of type `Movie`

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (k:Actor {name:'Keanu Reeves'})-[:ACTED_IN {role:'Neo'}]->(m:Movie {title:'The Matrix'}),
       (t:Actor {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN {role:'Forrest'}]->(f:Movie {title:'Forrest Gump'})
RETURN *
----

image::apoc.refactor.cloneNodesWithRelationships.dataset.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

.The following creates copies of both of these nodes and their relationships:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (k:Actor {name:'Keanu Reeves'}), (t:Actor {name:'Tom Hanks'})
CALL apoc.refactor.cloneNodesWithRelationships([k,t])
YIELD input, output
RETURN *
----

As result we have a copy of the nodes and relationships
