= Generating Graphs
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to generate example graphs.



Generate undirected (random direction) graphs with semi-real random distributions based on theoretical models. Providing
a node label will generate nodes with that label and a random uuid property. Providing a relationship type will generate
relationships with that type. Providing `null` in place of labels and/or relationships will generate random `Person` nodes
with a random `name` and `FRIEND_OF` relationships, respectively.

For a theoretical introduction, please take a look at the following blog posts:

* http://graphaware.com/graph/theory/2014/07/16/random-graphs-part-one.html[Random Graph Models (Part I)]
* http://graphaware.com/graph/theory/2014/08/06/random-graphs-part-two.html[Random Graph Models (Part II)]

For permitted configuration values, please look at the Javadoc of config classes of the respective generators (`BarabasiAlbertConfig`,
`ErdosRenyiConfig`, `WattsStrogatzConfig`, and `DistributionBasedConfig`).

Apart from the number of nodes you would like to generate, `null` can be passed in for all other parameters. Sensible
 defaults will be used.
