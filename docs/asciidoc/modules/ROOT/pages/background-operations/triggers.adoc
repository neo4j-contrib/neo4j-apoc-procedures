APOC Core provides a set of procedures for running Cypher queries that are called when data in Neo4j is changed (created, updated, deleted).

https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/background-operations/triggers/[See here for more info].

In addition, APOC Extended provides some helper procedures to more easily manipulate Cypher queries and solve some transaction use cases that cannot be solved otherwise.
