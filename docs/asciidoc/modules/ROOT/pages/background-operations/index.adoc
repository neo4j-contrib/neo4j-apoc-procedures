:description: This chapter describes procedures that can be used to schedule execution of Cypher statements to run in the background.



Sometimes you want to schedule execution of Cypher statements to run regularly in the background or asynchronously ("fire & forget").
This can also be useful in cloud environments that limit the runtime of statements (e.g. to 2 or 5 minutes) by scheduling execution in the background.

The `apoc.periodic.*` procedures provide such capabilities.
