:description: This chapter describes procedures that can be used to schedule the asynchronous execution of Cypher statements.



The `apoc.periodic.*` procedures can be used to schedule the execution of Cypher statements as asynchronous background jobs.
This can also be useful in cloud environments that limit the execution time of statements (e.g. to 2 or 5 minutes).

It is also possible to define listeners on one or more folders which trigger the executing of custom cypher queries if changes are observed:
