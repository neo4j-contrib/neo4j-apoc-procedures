:description: This chapter describes a list of information to consider using the APOC library.

To use the APOC library it's necessary to consider the following issues.

.Memory tracker

The APOC procedures (and in general, the Neo4j procedures), currently are not detected by Neo4j Memory Tracker.
This means that, for example, the xref::overview/apoc.path/apoc.path.expand.adoc[apoc.path.expand] procedure 
doesn't stop if `dbms.memory.transaction.database_max_size` is reached, 
and we cannot use the `call dbms.listTransactions() yield currentQuery, estimatedUsedHeapMemory` to monitor the memory usage of the query. 
Therefore, please use the procedure carefully to avoid Java Heap space errors.
