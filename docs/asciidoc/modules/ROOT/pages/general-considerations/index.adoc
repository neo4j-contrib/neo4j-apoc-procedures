:description: This chapter describes a list of information to consider using the APOC Extended library.

To use the APOC Extended library, it is necessary to consider the following issues.

.Memory tracker

The APOC Extended procedures (and in general, the Neo4j procedures), currently are not detected by Neo4j Memory Tracker.
This means that, for example, the apoc.path.expand procedure
doesn't stop if `dbms.memory.transaction.database_max_size` is reached, 
and we cannot use the `SHOW TRANSACTIONS yield currentQuery, estimatedUsedHeapMemory` command to monitor the memory usage of the query.
Therefore, please use the procedure carefully to avoid Java Heap space errors.
