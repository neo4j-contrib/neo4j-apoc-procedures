:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to access the contents of Neo4j system db.



In Neo4j 4.0 the concept of multi-database was introduced. There's now a database called `system` which contains some
internal information, e.g. configured permissions. Those can be exposed by APOC.

Do not rely on the data structures within `system` database. They are a non-public implementation details of Neo4j
and might change within minor release updates.
