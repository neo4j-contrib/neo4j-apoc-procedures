We can use Cypher as a safe, graph-aware, partially compiled scripting language within APOC.

[[cypher-fast-node-count-by-label]]
== Example: Fast Node-Counts by Label

We can quickly compute the number of nodes for a specific label using the `count` function, but only if that's the only single thing in the query.
For example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*);
----

We can also combine several with `UNION ALL`:

.Works
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*)
UNION ALL
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN count(*);
----

But we can't do the same thing using the `WITH` clause:

.Doesn't work
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person)
WITH count(*) as people
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN people, count(*) as movies;
----

This query will work out the count by iterating over all nodes, which is a very slow operation
