= Run Cypher Script Files
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to execute files that contain Cypher statements.



Runs each statement in the file / each file, all semicolon separated

These procedures can be used to run files that are usually run by cypher-shell.
e.g. files generated by xref::export/cypher.adoc[].
They automatically skip `:begin/:commit/:rollback` operations as they are executed in a single transaction per file.
