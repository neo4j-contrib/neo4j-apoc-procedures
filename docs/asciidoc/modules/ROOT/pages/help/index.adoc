= Built in Help
:description: This chapter describes the built in help in the APOC library.



The APOC library ships with the `apoc.help` procedure, which can be used for procedure and function discovery.

Running `call apoc.help('keyword')` will lists all procedures and functions that have the keyword in their name.
If no keyword is provided, it will return a list of all APOC procedures and functions, along with their signatures and descriptions.


If you use `RETURN apoc.version()` it displays the current APOC version.

[NOTE]
====
To generate the help output, this procedure uses the built in `dbms.procedures()` and `dbms.functions()` procedures.

== Procedure & Function Signatures

To call procedures correctly, you need to know their parameter names, types and positions.
And for YIELDing their results, you have to know the output column names and types.

INFO:The signatures are shown in error messages, if you use a procedure incorrectly.

You can see the procedures signature in the output of `CALL apoc.help("name")`

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.help("dijkstra")
----

The signature is always `name : : TYPE`, so in this case:

----
apoc.algo.dijkstra
 (startNode :: NODE?, endNode :: NODE?,
   relationshipTypesAndDirections :: STRING?, weightPropertyName :: STRING?)
:: (path :: PATH?, weight :: FLOAT?)
----
