= Export data to S3
:description: This section gives an overview on how exporting procedures can be used with S3.

To export to S3, the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/download/{apoc-release}/apoc-aws-dependencies-{apoc-release}.jar[APOC AWS dependency jar] needs to be downloaded and copied into the plugins directory, _<NEO4J_HOME>/plugins_.

After copying the jars into the plugins directory, the database will need to be restarted.
