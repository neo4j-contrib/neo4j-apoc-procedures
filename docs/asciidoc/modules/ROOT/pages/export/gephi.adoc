= Export to Gephi
:description: This section describes a procedure that can be used to export data into the Gephi visualization tool.



Gephi has a https://gephi.org/plugins/#/plugin/graphstreaming/[streaming plugin], that can provide and accept https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/GraphStreaming#Gephi_as_Master[JSON-graph-data] in a streaming fashion.
The export to Gephi procedure sends data to this end point.

[[export-gephi-install-plugin]]
== Installing the plugin

Make sure to install the plugin first and activate it for your workspace (there is a new "Streaming"-tab besides "Layout"), right-click "Master"->"start" to start the server.

You can provide your workspace name (you might want to rename it before you start thes streaming), otherwise it defaults to `workspace0`

The default Gephi-URL is http://localhost:8080, resulting in `http://localhost:8080/workspace0?operation=updateGraph`

It can also be configured by adding the following to `apoc.conf`:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.gephi.url=url
----

or

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.gephi.<key>.url=url
----

[[export-gephi-format]]
== Export Format

All nodes and relationships of the passed in data are converted into individual Gephi-Streaming JSON fragements, separated by \r\n. `\r\n`.

.Example of exported JSON
[source,javascript]
----
{"an":{"123":{"TYPE":"Person:Actor","label":"Tom Hanks",                           x:333,y:222,r:0.1,g:0.3,b:0.5}}}\r\n
{"an":{"345":{"TYPE":"Movie","label":"Forrest Gump",                               x:234,y:122,r:0.2,g:0.2,b:0.7}}}\r\n
{"ae":{"3344":{"TYPE":"ACTED_IN","label":"Tom Hanks",source:"123",target:"345","directed":true,"weight":1.0,r:0.1,g:0.3,b:0.5}}}
----

[NOTE]
====
Gephi doesn't render the graph data unless you also provide x,y coordinates in the payload, so the procedures send random ones within a 1000x1000 grid.

Colors are generated per label combination and relationship-type, both of which are also transferred as `TYPE` property.

Weight properties are stored as a number (integer,float) or a string.
If the weight property is invalid or null, a default value of 1.0 will be used.

[[export-gephi-examples]]
== Examples

You can export your graph as an unweighted network.

.The following exports `ACTED_IN` paths
[source,cypher]
----
match path = (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
WITH path LIMIT 1000
with collect(path) as paths
call apoc.gephi.add(null,'workspace0', paths) yield nodes, relationships, time
return nodes, relationships, time
----

You can export your graph as a weighted network, by specifying the property of a relationship, that holds the weight value.

.The following exports `ACTED_IN` paths where the `weightproperty` property exists on the relationship type
[source,cypher]
----
match path = (:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie) where exists r.weightproperty
WITH path LIMIT 1000
with collect(path) as paths
call apoc.gephi.add(null,'workspace0', paths, 'weightproperty') yield nodes, relationships, time
return nodes, relationships, time
----

You can also export with your graph other properties of your nodes and/or relationship by adding an optional array with the property names you want to export.

.The following exports `ACTED_IN` paths, but only includes the `birthYear` and `role` properties
[source,cypher]
----
match path = (:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie) where exists r.weightproperty
WITH path LIMIT 1000
with collect(path) as paths
call apoc.gephi.add(null,'workspace0', paths, 'weightproperty',['birthYear', 'role']) yield nodes, relationships, time
return nodes, relationships, time
