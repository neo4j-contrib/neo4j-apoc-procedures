= RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation Procedures
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to access the RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation.

== Query with Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique

This procedure `apoc.ml.rag` takes a list of paths or a vector index name, relevant attributes and a natural language question
to create a prompt implementing a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique.

See https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/[here] for more info about the RAG process.

It uses the `chat/completions` API which is https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create[documented here^].



.Input Parameters
[%autowidth, opts=header]
|===
| name | description | mandatory
| paths | the list of paths to retrieve and augment the prompt, it can also be a matching query or a vector index name | yes
| attributes | the relevant attributes useful to retrieve and augment the prompt | yes
| question | the user question | yes
| conf | An optional configuration map, please check the next section | no
|===


.Configuration map
[%autowidth, opts=header]
|===
| name | description | mandatory
| getLabelTypes | add the label / rel-type names to the info to augment the prompt | no, default `true`
| embeddings | to search similar embeddings stored into a node vector index (in case of `embeddings: "NODE"`) or relationship vector index (in case of `embeddings: "REL"`) | no, default `"FALSE"`
| topK | number of neighbors to find for each node (in case of `embeddings: "NODE"`) or relationships (in case of `embeddings: "REL"`) | no, default `40`
| apiKey | OpenAI API key | in case `apoc.openai.key` is not defined
| prompt | the base prompt to be augmented with the context | no, default is:

"You are a customer service agent that helps a customer with answering questions about a service.
Use the following context to answer the `user question` at the end.
Make sure not to make any changes to the context if possible when prepare answers to provide accurate responses.
If you don't know the answer, just say \`Sorry, I don't know`, don't try to make up an answer."

Using the apoc.ml.rag procedure we can reduce AI hallucinations (i.e. false or misleading responses),
providing relevant and up-to-date information to our procedure via the 1st parameter.

For example, by executing the following procedure (with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, last updated in January 2022)
we have a hallucination

.Query call
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.ml.openai.chat([
    {role:"user", content: "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?"}
], $apiKey)
----

.Example response
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| The gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics was won by the Swedish men's team and the Russian women's team.
|===

So, we can use the RAG technique to provide real results.
For example with the given dataset (with data taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics[this wikipedia page]):

.wikipedia dataset
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (mixed2022:Discipline {title:"Mixed doubles's curling", year: 2022})
WITH mixed2022
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Stefania Constantini', country: 'Italy', irrelevant: 'asdasd'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Gold', irrelevant2: 'asdasd'}]->(mixed2022)
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Amos Mosaner', country: 'Italy', irrelevant: 'qweqwe'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Gold', irrelevant2: 'rwerew'}]->(mixed2022)
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Kristin Skaslien', country: 'Norway', irrelevant: 'dfgdfg'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Silver', irrelevant2: 'gdfg'}]->(mixed2022)
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Magnus Nedregotten', country: 'Norway', irrelevant: 'xcvxcv'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Silver', irrelevant2: 'asdasd'}]->(mixed2022)
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Almida de Val', country: 'Sweden', irrelevant: 'rtyrty'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Bronze', irrelevant2: 'bfbfb'}]->(mixed2022)
CREATE (:Athlete {name: 'Oskar Eriksson', country: 'Sweden', irrelevant: 'qwresdc'})-[:HAS_MEDAL {medal: 'Bronze', irrelevant2: 'juju'}]->(mixed2022)
----

we can execute:

.Query call
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(:Athlete)-[:HAS_MEDAL]->(Discipline)
WITH collect(path) AS paths
CALL apoc.ml.rag(paths,
  ["name", "country", "medal", "title", "year"],
  "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----

.Example response
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| The gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics was won by Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy.
|===

or:

.Query call
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(:Athlete)-[:HAS_MEDAL]->(Discipline)
WITH collect(path) AS paths
CALL apoc.ml.rag(paths,
  ["name", "country", "medal", "title", "year"],
  "Which athletes won the silver medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----

.Example response
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| The gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics was won by Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten from Norway.
|===

or:

.Query call with custom model
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(:Athlete)-[:HAS_MEDAL]->(Discipline)
WITH collect(path) AS paths
CALL apoc.ml.rag(paths,
  ["name", "country", "medal", "title", "year"],
  "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey, model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----

.Example response
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| The athletes who won the gold medal in mixed doubles curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics were Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy.
|===


We can also pass a string query returning paths/relationships/nodes, for example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.ml.rag("MATCH path=(:Athlete)-[:HAS_MEDAL]->(Discipline) WITH collect(path) AS paths",
  ["name", "country", "medal", "title", "year"],
  "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----

.Example response
[opts="header"]
|===
| value
| The gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics was won by Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy.
|===

or we can pass a vector index name as the 1st parameter, in case we stored useful info into embedding nodes.
For example, given this node vector index:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX `rag-embeddings`
FOR (n:RagEmbedding) ON (n.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

and some (:RagEmbedding) nodes with the `text` properties, we can execute:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.ml.rag("rag-embeddings",
  ["text"],
  "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey, embeddings: "NODE", topK: 20}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----

or, with a relationship vector index:


[source,cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX `rag-rel-embeddings`
FOR ()-[r:RAG_EMBEDDING]-() ON (r.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

and some [:RagEmbedding] relationships with the `text` properties, we can execute:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.ml.rag("rag-rel-embeddings",
  ["text"],
  "Which athletes won the gold medal in mixed doubles's curling  at the 2022 Winter Olympics?",
  {apiKey: $apiKey, embeddings: "REL", topK: 20}
) YIELD value
RETURN value
----
