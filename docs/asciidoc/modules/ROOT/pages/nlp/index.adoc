:description: This chapter describes procedures that can be used for added Natural Language Processing (NLP) functionality to graph applications.



The procedures described in this chapter act as wrappers around cloud based Natural Language APIs.
These procedures extract entities, key phrases, categories, and sentiment from text stored as node properties.

Neo4j offers powerful querying capabilities for structured data, but a lot of the worldâ€™s data exists in text documents. NLP techniques can help to extract the latent structure in these documents. This structure could be as simple as nodes representing tokens in a sentence or as complicated as nodes representing entities extracted using a named entity recognition algorithm.

== Why NLP?

Extracting structure from text documents and storing it in a graph enables several different use cases, including:

* Content based recommendations
* Natural Language search
* Document similarity


=== apoc.nlp.* procedures

It contains procedures that call the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure Natural Language APIs, and create a graph based on the results returned.

These procedures support entity extraction, key phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and document classification.
