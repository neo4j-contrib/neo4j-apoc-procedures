:description: This chapter describes procedures that wrap Google Cloud Platform's Natural Language API.



Google Cloud Platform's https://cloud.google.com/natural-language[Natural Language API^] lets users derive insights from unstructured text using Google machine learning.
The procedures in this chapter act as a wrapper around calls to this API to extract entities, categories, or sentiment from text stored as node properties.

Each procedure has two modes:

* Stream - returns a map constructed from the JSON returned from the API
* Graph - creates a graph or virtual graph based on the values returned by the API

[NOTE]
====
The procedures described in this chapter make API calls and subsequent updates to the database on the calling thread.
If we want to make parallel requests to the API and avoid out of memory errors from keeping too much transaction state in memory while running procedures that write to the database, see <<nlp-gcp-examples-batching>>.

[NOTE]
====
At the moment, GCP Natural Language API supports text input in more than 10 languages.  
For better results, make sure that your text is one of the https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/languages[supported languages by Natural Language API].
If we input a text of an unsupported language, you might get a "HTTP response code: 400" error.

[[nlp-gcp-entities]]
=== Entity Extraction

The entity extraction procedures (`apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.*`) are wrappers around the https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/analyzeEntities[`documents.analyzeEntities`^] method of the Google Natural Language API.
This API method finds named entities (currently proper names and common nouns) in the text along with entity types, salience, mentions for each entity, and other properties.

The procedures are described below:

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="1"]
|===
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream-lite.csv[]
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph-lite.csv[lines=2;]
|===

The procedures support the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| key | String | null | API Key for Google Natural Language API
| nodeProperty | String | text | The property on the provided node that contains the unstructured text to be analyzed
|===

In addition, `apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph` supports the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| scoreCutoff | Double | 0.0 | Lower limit for the salience score of an entity to be present in the graph. Value must be between 0 and 1.

Salience is an indicator of the importance or centrality of that entity to the entire document text. Scores closer to 0 are less salient, while scores closer to 1.0 are highly salient.
| write | Boolean | false | persist the graph of entities
| writeRelationshipType | String | ENTITY | relationship type for relationships from source node to entity nodes
| writeRelationshipProperty | String | score | relationship property for relationships from source node to entity nodes

[[nlp-gcp-classify]]
=== Classification

The entity extraction procedures (`apoc.nlp.gcp.classify.*`) are wrappers around the https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/classifyText[`documents.classifyText`^] method of the Google Natural Language API.
This API method classifies a document into categories.

The procedures are described below:

[[nlp-gcp-api-key]]
== Setting up API Key

We can generate an API Key that has access to the Cloud Natural Language API by going to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials^].
Once we've created a key, we can populate and execute the following command to create a parameter that contains these details.

.The following defines the `apiKey` parameter
[source,cypher]
----
:param apiKey => ("<api-key-here>")
----

Alternatively we can add these credentials to `apoc.conf` and load them using the static value storage functions.
See xref::misc/static-values.adoc[].

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.static.gcp.apiKey=<api-key-here>
----


.The following retrieves GCP credentials from `apoc.conf`
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.static.getAll("gcp") AS gcp;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| gcp
| {apiKey: "<api-key-here>"}
|===

[[nlp-gcp-examples-batching]]
== Batching Requests

Batching requests to the GCP API and the processing of results can be done using xref:graph-updates/periodic-execution.adoc#commit-batching[Periodic Iterate].
This approach is useful if we want to make parallel requests to the GCP API and reduce the amount of transaction state kept in memory while running procedures that write to the database.

.The following creates an entity graph in batches of 25 nodes
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate("
  MATCH (n)
  WITH collect(n) as total
  CALL apoc.coll.partition(total, 25)
  YIELD value as nodes
  RETURN nodes", "
  CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph(nodes, {
    key: $apiKey,
    nodeProperty: 'body',
    writeRelationshipType: 'GCP_ENTITY',
    write:true
  })
  YIELD graph
  RETURN distinct 'done'", {
    batchSize: 1,
    params: { apiKey: $apiKey }
  }
);

[[nlp-gcp-examples-entities]]
=== Entity Extraction

Let's start by extracting the entities from the Article node.
The text that we want to analyze is stored in the `body` property of the node, so we'll need to specify that via the `nodeProperty` configuration parameter.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
RETURN entity;
----

| {name: "8", salience: 0, metadata: {value: "8"}, type: "NUMBER", mentions: [{type: "TYPE_UNKNOWN", text: {content: "8", beginOffset: -1}}]}
|===

We get back 12 different entities.
We could then apply a Cypher statement that creates one node per entity and an `ENTITY` relationship from each of those nodes back to the `Article` node.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article and then creates nodes for each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
MERGE (e:Entity {name: entity.name})
SET e.type = entity.type
MERGE (a)-[:ENTITY]->(e)
----

Alternatively we can use the graph mode to automatically create the entity graph.
As well as having the `Entity` label, each entity node will have another label based on the value of the `type` property.
By default a virtual graph is returned.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph.svg[title="Pokemon entities graph"]

We can compute the entities for multiple nodes by passing a list of nodes to the procedure.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph.svg[title="Pokemon and Nintendo Switch entities graph"]

On this visualization we can also see the score for each entity node.
This score represents importance of that entity in the entire document.
We can specify a minimum cut off value for the score using the `scoreCutoff` property.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY",
  scoreCutoff: 0.01
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.gcp.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg[title="Pokemon and Nintendo Switch entities graph with importance >= 0.01"]

If we're happy with this graph and would like to persist it in Neo4j, we can do this by specifying the `write: true` configuration.

.The following creates a `HAS_ENTITY` relationship from the article to each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  scoreCutoff: 0.01,
  writeRelationshipType: "HAS_ENTITY",
  writeRelationshipProperty: "gcpEntityScore",
  write: true
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can then write a query to return the entities that have been created.

.The following returns articles and their entities
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (article:Article)
RETURN article.uri AS article,
       [(article)-[r:HAS_ENTITY]->(e) | {entity: e.text, score: r.gcpEntityScore}] AS entities;

=== Classification

Now let's extract categories from the Article node.
The text that we want to analyze is stored in the `body` property of the node, so we'll need to specify that via the `nodeProperty` configuration parameter.

.The following streams the categories for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.classify.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.categories AS category
RETURN category;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| category
| {name: "/Games", confidence: 0.91}
|===

We get back only one category
We could then apply a Cypher statement that creates one node per category and a `CATEGORY` relationship from each of those nodes back to the `Article` node.

.The following streams the categories for the Pokemon article and then creates nodes for each category
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.classify.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.categories AS category
MERGE (c:Category {name: category.name})
MERGE (a)-[:CATEGORY]->(c)
----


Alternatively we can use the graph mode to automatically create the category graph.
As well as having the `Category` label, each category node will have another label based on the value of the `type` property.
By default, a virtual graph is returned.

.The following returns a virtual graph of categories for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.classify.graph(a, {

  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "CATEGORY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
