= Tutorial: Build a Knowledge Graph using NLP and Ontologies

[#introduction]
== Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a Software Knowledge Graph based on:

* Articles taken from dev.to, a developer blogging platform, and the entities extracted (using NLP techniques) from those articles.
* Software ontologies extracted from Wikidata, the free and open knowledge base that acts as central storage for the structured data of Wikipedia.

Once we've done that we'll learn how to query the Knowledge Graph to find interesting insights that are enabled by combining NLP and Ontologies.

[NOTE]
====
The queries and data used in this guide can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-examples/nlp-knowledge-graph[neo4j-examples/nlp-knowledge-graph^] GitHub repository.

[#tools]
== Tools

We're going to use a couple of plugin libraries in this tutorial, so you'll need to install those if you want to follow along with the examples.

[#neosemantics]
=== neosemantics (n10s)

image:n10s.png[float="right", width="100px"]

https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics[neosemantics^] is a plugin that enables the use of RDF and its associated vocabularies like OWL, RDFS, SKOS, and others in Neo4j.
We're going to use this tool to import ontologies into Neo4j.

[NOTE]
====
neosemantics only supports the Neo4j 4.0.x and 3.5.x series. It does not yet support the Neo4j 4.1.x series.
====

We can install neosemantics by following the instructions in the https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/installation/[project installation guide^].

Both of these tools can be installed in Docker environments, and the project repository contains a https://github.com/neo4j-examples/nlp-knowledge-graph/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml^] file that shows how to do this.

[#what-is-knowledge-graph]
== What is a Knowledge Graph?

There are many different definitions of https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/[Knowledge Graphs^].
In this tutorial, the definition of a Knowledge Graph is a graph that contains the following:

Facts :: Instance data. This would include graph data imported from any data source and could be structured (e.g. JSON/XML) or semi structured (e.g. HTML)

Explicit Knowledge :: Explicit description of how instance data relates. This comes from ontologies, taxonomies, or any kind of metadata definition.

[#import-onologies]
== Importing Wikidata Ontologies

image:1280px-Wikidata-logo-en.svg.png[float="right", width="100px"]

Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
It acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others.

[#wikidata-api]
=== Wikidata SPARQL API

Wikidata provides a https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service[SPARQL API^] that lets users query the data directly.
The screenshot below shows an example of a SPARQL query along with the results from running that query:

.Querying a Software Taxonomy in the Wikidata SPARQL API
image::wikidata-api.png[Querying a Software Taxonomy in the Wikidata SPARQL API]

This query starts from the entity https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2429814[Q2429814^] (Software System) and then transitively finds children of that entity as far as it can.
If we run the query we get a stream of triples (subject, predicate, object).

https://query.wikidata.org/#prefix%20neo%3A%20%3Cneo4j%3A%2F%2Fvoc%23%3E%20%0A%23Cats%0A%23SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3Flabel%20%0ACONSTRUCT%20%7B%0A%3Fitem%20a%20neo%3ACategory%20%3B%20neo%3AsubCatOf%20%3FparentItem%20.%20%20%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20neo%3Aname%20%3Flabel%20.%0A%20%20%3FparentItem%20a%20neo%3ACategory%3B%20neo%3Aname%20%3FparentLabel%20.%0A%20%20%3Farticle%20a%20neo%3AWikipediaPage%3B%20neo%3Aabout%20%3Fitem%20%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%7D%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20%28wdt%3AP31%7Cwdt%3AP279%29%2a%20wd%3AQ2429814%20.%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%7Cwdt%3AP279%20%3FparentItem%20.%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20rdfs%3Alabel%20%3Flabel%20.%0A%20%20filter%28lang%28%3Flabel%29%20%3D%20%22en%22%29%0A%20%20%3FparentItem%20rdfs%3Alabel%20%3FparentLabel%20.%0A%20%20filter%28lang%28%3FparentLabel%29%20%3D%20%22en%22%29%0A%20%20%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%3Farticle%20schema%3Aabout%20%3Fitem%20%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20schema%3AinLanguage%20%22en%22%20%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20schema%3AisPartOf%20%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2F%3E%20.%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%0A%7D[Try out the SPARQL query^,role=more information]

We're now going to learn how to import Wikidata into Neo4j using neosemantics.

Now we're going to import the Wikidata taxonomies.
We can get an importable URL directly from the Wikidata SPARQL API, by clicking on the `Code` button:

.Getting an importable URI for a Wikidata SPARQL query
image::copy-sparql-api.png[Getting an importable URI for a Wikidata SPARQL query, link="{imagesdir}/copy-sparql-api.png",role="popup-link"]

We then pass that URL to the `n10s.rdf.import.fetch` procedure, which will import the stream of triples into Neo4j.

The examples below contain queries that import taxonomies starting from Software Systems, Programming Languages, and Data Formats.

[#view-taxonomy]
=== Viewing the taxonomy

Let's have a look at what's been imported.
We can get an overview of the contents of our database by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.meta.stats()
YIELD labels, relTypes, relTypesCount
RETURN labels, relTypes, relTypesCount;
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|====
| labels | relTypes | relTypesCount
| {Category: 2308, _NsPrefDef: 1, _MapNs: 1, Resource: 3868, _MapDef: 2, WikipediaPage: 1560, _GraphConfig: 1} | {`()-[:SUB_CAT_OF]->(:Resource)`: 3636, `(:WikipediaPage)-[:ABOUT]->()`: 1560, `(:Resource)-[:ABOUT]->()`: 1560, `()-[:ABOUT]->(:Resource)`: 1560, `()-[:_IN]->()`: 2, `()-[:ABOUT]->(:Category)`: 1560, `()-[:SUB_CAT_OF]->(:Category)`: 3636, `()-[:_IN]->(:_MapNs)`: 2, `(:Resource)-[:SUB_CAT_OF]->()`: 3636, `(:_MapDef)-[:_IN]->()`: 2, `()-[:SUB_CAT_OF]->()`: 3636, `()-[:ABOUT]->()`: 1560, `(:Category)-[:SUB_CAT_OF]->()`: 3636} | {SUB_CAT_OF: 7272, _IN: 2, ABOUT: 3120}
|====

Any labels or relationships types that have a `_prefix` can be ignores as they represent meta data created by the n10s library.

We can see that we've imported over 2,000 `Category` nodes and 1,700 `WikipediaPage` nodes.
Every node that we create using n10s will have a `Resource` label, which is why we have over 4,000 nodes with this label.

We also have more than 7,000 `SUB_CAT_OF` relationship types connecting the `Category` nodes and 3,000 `ABOUT` relationship types connecting the `WikipediaPage` nodes to the `Category` nodes.

Let's now have a look at some of the actual data that we've imported.
We can look at the sub categories of the version control node by running the following query:

.Finding sub categories of version control

----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="version-control"]

So far, so good!

[#importing-devto]
== Importing dev.to articles

https://dev.to/[dev.to^] is a developer blogging platform and contains articles on a variety of topics, including NoSQL databases, JavaScript frameworks, the latest AWS API, chatbots, and more.
A screenshot of the home page is shown below:

.The dev.to home page

We're going to import some articles from dev.to into Neo4j.
https://github.com/neo4j-examples/nlp-knowledge-graph/blob/master/import/articles.csv[`articles.csv`^] contains a list of 30 articles of interest.
We can query this file using Cypher's `LOAD CSV` clause:

We're going to use APOC's https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/import/html/[`apoc.load.html`] procedure to scrape the interesting information from each of these URIs.
Let's first see how to use this procedure on a single article, as shown in the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
// <1>
MERGE (a:Article {uri: "https://dev.to/lirantal/securing-a-nodejs--rethinkdb--tls-setup-on-docker-containers"})
WITH a

 body: 'body div.spec__body p',
 title: 'h1',
 time: 'time'
})
YIELD value

UNWIND value.body AS item

// <3>
WITH a,
     apoc.text.join(collect(item.text), '') AS body,
     value.title[0].text AS title,
     value.time[0].attributes.datetime AS date

<4>
SET a.body = body , a.title = title, a.datetime = datetime(date)
RETURN a;
----

It isn‚Äôt used for any sort of big-data applications, but rather as a NoSQL database, which spices things up with real-time updates, and relational tables support.RethinkDB features an officially supported Node.js driver, as well as a community-maintained driver as well called rethinkdbdash which is promises-based, and provides connection pooling. There is also a database migration tool called rethinkdb-migrate that aids in managing database changes such as schema changes, database seeding, tear up and tear down capabilities.We‚Äôre going to use the official RethinkDB docker image from the docker hub and make use of docker-compose.yml to spin it up (later on you can add additional services to this setup).A fair example for docker-compose.yml:The compose file mounts a local tls directory as a mapped volume inside the container. The tls/ directory will contain our cert files, and the compose file is reflecting this.To setup a secure connection we need to facilitate it using certificates so an initial technical step:Important notes:Update the compose file to include a command configuration that starts the RethinkDB process with all the required SSL configurationImportant notes:You‚Äôll notice there isn‚Äôt any cluster related configuration but you can add them as well if you need to so they can join the SSL connection:‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcluster-tls‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcluster-tls-key /tls/key.pem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcluster-tls-cert /tls/cert.pem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcluster-tls-ca /tls/ca.pemThe RethinkDB drivers support an ssl optional object which either sets the certificate using the ca property, or sets the rejectUnauthorized property to accept or reject self-signed certificates when connecting. A snippet for the ssl configuration to pass to the driver:Now that the connection is secured, it only makes sense to connect using a user/password which are not the default.To set it up, update the compose file to also include the‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinitial-password argument so you can set the default admin user‚Äôs password. For example:Of course you need to append this argument to the rest of the command line options in the above compose file.Now, update the Node.js driver settings to use a user and password to connect:Congratulations! You‚Äôre now eligible to ‚ÄúReady for Production stickers.Don‚Äôt worry, I already mailed them to your address.", uri: "https://dev.to/lirantal/securing-a-nodejs--rethinkdb--tls-setup-on-docker-containers"})
|===

Now we're going to import the other articles.

We'll use the https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/overview/apoc.periodic/apoc.periodic.iterate/[`apoc.periodic.iterate`^] procedure so that we can parallelise this process.
This procedure takes in a data driven statement and an operation statement:

* The data driven statement contains a stream of items to process, which will be the stream of URIs.
* The operation statement defines what to do to each of these items, which will be to call `apoc.load.html` and create nodes with the `Article` label.

The final parameter is for providing config.
We're going to tell the procedure to process these items in batches of 5 that can be run concurrently.

We can see the call to the procedure in the following example:

We now have two disconnected sub graphs, which we can see in the diagram below:

.Articles and Taxonomies Sub Graphs
image::post-dev-to-import.png[Articles and Taxonomies Sub Graphs, link="{imagesdir}/post-dev-to-import.png",role="popup-link"]

On the left we have the Wikidata taxonomy graph, which represents the explicit knowledge in our Knowledge Graph.
And on the right we have the articles graph, which represents the facts in our Knowledge Graph.
We want to join these two graphs together, which we will do using NLP techniques.

[#entity-extraction]
== Article Entity Extraction

image:apoc_gcp.jpg[float="right", width="100px"]

In April 2020, the APOC standard library added https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/nlp/[procedures that wrap the NLP APIs^] of each of the big cloud providers - AWS, GCP, and Azure.
These procedures extract text from a node property and then send that text to APIs that extract entities, key phrases, categories, or sentiment.

We're going to use the https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/nlp/gcp/#nlp-gcp-entities[GCP Entity Extraction^] procedures on our articles.
The GCP NLP API returns Wikipedia pages for entities where those pages exist.

Before we do that we'll need to create an API key that has access to the Natural Language API.
Assuming that we're already created a GCP account, we can generate a key by following the instructions at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials^].
Once we've created a key, we'll create a parameter that contains it:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="set-key"]
----

We're going to use the `apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream` procedure, which will return a stream of entities found for the text content contained in a node property.
Before running this procedure against all of the articles, let's run it against one of them to see what data is returned:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://dev.to/lirantal/securing-a-nodejs--rethinkdb--tls-setup-on-docker-containers"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream(a, {
 nodeProperty: 'body',
 key: $key
})
YIELD node, value
SET node.processed = true
WITH node, value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
RETURN entity
LIMIT 5;
----

| {name: "database", salience: 0.01957906, metadata: {}, type: "OTHER", mentions: [{type: "COMMON", text: {content: "database", beginOffset: -1}}]}
|===

Each row contains a `name` property that describes the entity.
`salience` is an indicator of the importance or centrality of that entity to the entire document text.

Some entities also contain a Wikipedia URL, which is found via the `metadata.wikipedia_url` key.
The first entity, RethinkDB, is the only entity in this list that has such a URL.
We're going to filter the rows returned to only include ones that have a Wikipedia URL and we'll then connect the `Article` nodes to the `WikipediaPage` nodes that have that URL.

Let's have a look at how we're going to do this for one article:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://dev.to/lirantal/securing-a-nodejs--rethinkdb--tls-setup-on-docker-containers"})
CALL apoc.nlp.gcp.entities.stream(a, {
 nodeProperty: 'body',
 key: $key
})

<1>
YIELD node, value

SET node.processed = true
WITH node, value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity

// <2>
WITH entity, node
WHERE not(entity.metadata.wikipedia_url is null)

// <3>
MERGE (page:Resource {uri: entity.metadata.wikipedia_url})
SET page:WikipediaPage

// <4>
MERGE (node)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(page)
----
<1> `node` is the article and `value` contains the extracted entities
<2> Only include entities that have a Wikipedia URL
<3> Find a node that matches the Wikipedia URL. Create one if it doesn't already exist.
<4> Create a `HAS_ENTITY` relationship between the `Article` node and `WikipediaPage`

We can see how running this query connects the article and taxonomy sub graphs by looking at the following Neo4j Browser visualization:

.One article's entity graph
image::one-article-entities.svg[One article's entity graph, link="{imagesdir}/one-article-entities.svg",role="popup-link"]

Now we can run the entity extraction technique over the rest of the articles with help from the `apoc.periodic.iterate` procedure again:

[#querying-the-knowledge-graph]
== Querying the Knowledge Graph

It's now time to query the Knowledge Graph.

[#semantic-search]
=== Semantic Search

The first query that we're going to do is semantic search.
The `n10s.inference.nodesInCategory` procedure lets us search from a top level category, finding all its transitive sub categories, and then returns nodes attached to any of those categories.

In our graph the nodes connected to category nodes are `WikipediaPage` nodes.
We'll therefore need to add an extra `MATCH` clause to our query to find the connected articles via the `HAS_ENTITY` relationship type.
We can see how to do this in the following query:

Although we've searched for NoSQL, we can see from the results that a couple of articles don't link directly to that category.
For example, we have a couple of articles about Apache Zookeeper.
We can see how this category is connected to NoSQL by writing the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="zookeeper"]
----

.Zookeeper to NoSQL
image::zookeeper-nosql.png[Zookeeper to NoSQL,role="popup-link"]

So Apache Zookeeper is actually a couple of levels away from the NoSQL category.


[#similar-articles]
=== Similar Articles

Another thing that we can do with our Knowledge Graph is find similar articles based on the entities that articles have in common.
The simplest version of this query would be to find other articles that share common entities, as shown in the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="similar-articles-1"]
----

.Finding similar articles
image::similar-articles-1.png[Finding similar articles, link="{imagesdir}/similar-articles-1.png",role="popup-link"]

The Neo4j performance testing article is about Neo4j, and there are two other Neo4j articles that we could recommend to a reader that liked this article.

We can also use the category taxonomy in our query.
We can find articles that share a common parent category by writing the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="similar-articles-2"]
----

Note that in this query we'll also returning the path from the initial article to the other article.
So for "Couchbase GeoSearch with ASP.NET Core", there is a path that goes from the initial article to the Neo4j category, from there to the proprietary software category, which is also a parent of the Couchbase Server Category, which the "Couchbase GeoSearch with ASP.NET Core" article is connected to.

This shows off another nice feature of Knowledge Graphs - as well as making a recommendation, it's easy to explain why it was made as well.

[#custom-onotology]
== Adding a custom ontology

We might not consider proprietary software to be a very good measure of similarity between two technology products.
It would be unlikely that we're looking for similar articles based on this type of similarity.

But a common way that software products are connected is via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack[technology stacks^].
We could therefore create our own ontology containing some of these stacks.

http://www.nsmntx.org/2020/08/swStacks[nsmntx.org/2020/08/swStacks] contains an ontology for the GRANDstack, MEAN Stack, and LAMP Stack.
Before we import this ontology, let's setup some mappings in n10s:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="custom-ontology-init"]
----

And now we can preview the import on the ontology by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="custom-ontology-preview"]
----

.Software Stacks Ontology
image::stacks.svg[Software Stacks Ontology, link="{imagesdir}/stacks.svg",role="popup-link"]

It looks good, so let's import it by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
include::../../examples/queries.cypher[tag="custom-ontology-import"]
----

.Results
[options="header"]

We can now re-run the similarity query, which will now return the following results:
