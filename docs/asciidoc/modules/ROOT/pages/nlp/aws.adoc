:description: This chapter describes procedures that wrap Amazon Web Services Comprehend Natural Language API.



The Amazon Web Services (AWS) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/index.html[Comprehend Natural Language API^] uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text.
The procedures in this chapter act as a wrapper around calls to this API to extract entities and key phrases from text stored as node properties.

Each procedure has two modes:

* Stream - returns a map constructed from the JSON returned from the API
* Graph - creates a graph or virtual graph based on the values returned by the API

[NOTE]
====
The procedures described in this chapter make API calls and subsequent updates to the database on the calling thread.
If we want to make parallel requests to the API and avoid out of memory errors from keeping too much transaction state in memory while running procedures that write to the database, see <<nlp-aws-examples-batching>>.

[[nlp-aws-entities]]
=== Entity Extraction

The entity extraction procedures (`apoc.nlp.aws.entities.*`) are wrappers around the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-entities.html[Detect Entities^] operations of the AWS Comprehend Natural Language API.
This API method finds entities in the text, which are defined as a textual reference to the unique name of a real-world object such as people, places, and commercial items, and to precise references to measures such as dates and quantities.

The procedures are described below:

[[nlp-aws-sentiment]]
=== Sentiment

The sentiment procedures (`apoc.nlp.aws.sentiment.*`) are wrappers around the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-sentiment.html[Determine Sentiment^] operations of the AWS Comprehend Natural Language API.
You can determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.

[[nlp-aws-api-key]]
== Setting up API Key and Secret

We can generate an Access Key and Secret by following the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html^].
Once we've done that, we can populate and execute the following commands to create parameters that contains these details.

.The following define the `apiKey` and `apiSecret` parameters
[source,cypher]
----
:param apiKey => ("<api-key-here>");
:param apiSecret => ("<api-secret-here>");
----

Alternatively we can add these credentials to `apoc.conf` and retrieve them using the static value storage functions.
See xref::misc/static-values.adoc[].

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.static.aws.apiKey=<api-key-here>
apoc.static.aws.apiSecret=<api-secret-here>
----


.The following retrieves AWS credentials from `apoc.conf`
[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.static.getAll("aws") AS aws;
----

.Results

|===
| aws
| {apiKey: "<api-key-here>", apiSecret: "<api-secret-here>"}

[[nlp-aws-examples-batching]]
== Batching Requests

Batching requests to the AWS API and the processing of results can be done using xref:graph-updates/periodic-execution.adoc#commit-batching[Periodic Iterate].
This approach is useful if we want to make parallel requests to the AWS API and reduce the amount of transaction state kept in memory while running procedures that write to the database.


[NOTE]
====
The AWS Comprehend API processes a maximum of 25 documents in one request, so for optimal performance we should pass in lists that are a multiple of this size.
Keep in mind that if we pass in big lists this will result in more transaction state when writing to the database and may cause out of memory exceptions.
====

.The following creates an entity graph in batches of 25 nodes
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate("
  MATCH (n)
  WITH collect(n) as total
  CALL apoc.coll.partition(total, 25)
  YIELD value as nodes
  RETURN nodes", "
  CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(nodes, {
    key: $apiKey,
    secret: $apiSecret,
    nodeProperty: 'body',
    writeRelationshipType: 'AWS_ENTITY',
    write:true
  })
  YIELD graph
  RETURN distinct 'done'", {
    batchSize: 1,
    params: { apiKey: $apiKey, apiSecret: $apiSecret }

[[nlp-aws-examples-entities]]
=== Entity Extraction

Let's start by extracting the entities from the Article node.
The text that we want to analyze is stored in the `body` property of the node, so we'll need to specify that via the `nodeProperty` configuration parameter.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
RETURN entity;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| entity
| {score: 0.780032217502594, endOffset: 71, text: "Nintendo Switch", type: "COMMERCIAL_ITEM", beginOffset: 56}
| {score: 0.8155304193496704, endOffset: 151, text: "at least", type: "QUANTITY", beginOffset: 143}
| {score: 0.7507548332214355, endOffset: 156, text: "once", type: "QUANTITY", beginOffset: 152}
| {score: 0.8760746717453003, endOffset: 172, text: "twice a week", type: "QUANTITY", beginOffset: 160}
| {score: 0.9944096803665161, endOffset: 217, text: "Mario Kart 8", type: "TITLE", beginOffset: 205}
| {score: 0.9946564435958862, endOffset: 247, text: "Neo4j", type: "ORGANIZATION", beginOffset: 242}
| {score: 0.6274040937423706, endOffset: 256, text: "European", type: "LOCATION", beginOffset: 248}
|===

We get back 7 different entities.
We could then apply a Cypher statement that creates one node per entity and an `ENTITY` relationship from each of those nodes back to the `Article` node.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article and then creates nodes for each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
MERGE (e:Entity {name: entity.text})
SET e.type = entity.type
MERGE (a)-[:ENTITY]->(e)
----

Alternatively we can use the graph mode to automatically create the entity graph.
As well as having the `Entity` label, each entity node will have another label based on the value of the `type` property.
By default, a virtual graph is returned.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg[title="Pokemon entities graph"]

We can compute the entities for multiple nodes by passing a list of nodes to the procedure.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg[title="Pokemon and Nintendo Switch entities graph"]

On this visualization we can also see the score for each entity node.
This score represents the level of confidence that the API has in its detection of the entity.
We can specify a minimum cut off value for the score using the `scoreCutoff` property.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities with a score >= 0.7 for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  scoreCutoff: 0.7,
  writeRelationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph-cutoff.svg[title="Pokemon and Nintendo Switch entities graph with confidence >= 0.7"]

If we're happy with this graph and would like to persist it in Neo4j, we can do this by specifying the `write: true` configuration.

.The following creates a `HAS_ENTITY` relationship from the article to each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  scoreCutoff: 0.7,
  writeRelationshipType: "HAS_ENTITY",
  writeRelationshipProperty: "awsEntityScore",
  write: true
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can then write a query to return the entities that have been created.

.The following returns articles and their entities
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (article:Article)
RETURN article.uri AS article,
       [(article)-[r:HAS_ENTITY]->(e:Entity) | {text: e.text, score: r.awsEntityScore}] AS entities;
----

[[nlp-aws-examples-key-phrases]]
=== Key Phrases

Let's now extract the key phrases from the Article node.
The text that we want to analyze is stored in the `body` property of the node, so we'll need to specify that via the `nodeProperty` configuration parameter.

.The following streams the key phrases for the Pokemon article

Alternatively we can use the graph mode to automatically create a key phrase graph.
One node with the `KeyPhrase` label will be created for each key phrase extracted.

By default, a virtual graph is returned, but the graph can be persisted by specifying the `write: true` configuration.
