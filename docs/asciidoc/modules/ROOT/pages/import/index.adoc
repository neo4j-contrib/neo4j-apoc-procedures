:description: This chapter describes procedures in the APOC library that can be used to import data into Neo4j.



The APOC library adds support for loading and importing data from various data formats, including JSON, XML, and XLS.

* Loading data implies it is streamed into memory and can only be used in conjunction with other statements that are part
of the same query (`CREATE`, `MATCH`, etc).
* Importing data, on the other hand, will also store the data to disk, which can then be consulted and manipulated later on using Cypher queries.
