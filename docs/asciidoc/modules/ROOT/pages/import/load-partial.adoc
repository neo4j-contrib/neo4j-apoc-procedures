= Load CSV
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to import data from CSV files.

If we have large files locally or on http(s)/s3/gcp storage that you want to import into neo4j,
we can use this procedure that can provide a URL with an offset that can just read a string from a file (e.g. CSV).
We can also set an optional limit as the 3rd parameter, otherwise (with 0) it read until the end.
