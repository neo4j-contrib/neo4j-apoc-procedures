= Load XML
:description: This section describes procedures that can be used to import data from XML files.



Many existing enterprise applications, endpoints, and files use XML as data exchange format.
The Load XML procedures allow us to process these files.

[[load-xml-available-procedures]]
== Procedure and Function Overview

The table below describes the available procedures and functions:

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="5,1m,1m"]
|===
¦Qualified Name¦Type¦Release
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.load.xml.adoc[]
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.xml.parse.adoc[]
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.import.xml.adoc[]
|===

[[load-xml-available-procedures-apoc.load.xml]]
=== `apoc.load.xml`

This procedure takes a file or HTTP URL and parses the XML into a map data structure.

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="1m"]
|===
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.load.xml-lite.csv[]
|===

The map is created using the following rules:

* in simple mode, each type of children has its own entry in the parent map.
* the element-type as key is prefixed with `_` to prevent collisions with attributes.
* if there is a single element, the entry will just have that element as value, not a collection.
* if there is more than one element, there will be a list of values.
* each child will still have its `_type` field to discern them.

This procedure supports the following config parameters:

.Config
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| failOnError | boolean | true | fail if error encountered while parsing XML
| headers | Map | {} | HTTP headers to be used when querying XML document
| binary | `Enum[NONE, BYTES, GZIP, BZIP2, DEFLATE, BLOCK_LZ4, FRAMED_SNAPPY]`` | `null` | If not null, allow to take binary data instead of a file name/url as first parameter.
Similar to xref::partial$usage/apoc.import.json.adoc[Binary file example]
| charset | java.nio.charset.Charset | `UTF_8` | The optional charset, with `binary` config not null and with string as file
|===

[[load-xml-available-procedures-apoc.xml.parse]]
=== `apoc.xml.parse`

If our dataset contains nodes with XML as property values, they can be parsed into maps with the `apoc.xml.parse` function.

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="1m"]
|===
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.xml.parse-lite.csv[]
|===


This function supports the following config parameter:

.Config
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| failOnError | boolean | true | fail if error encountered while parsing XML
|===

.The following parses an XML string into a Cypher map
[source,cypher]
----
WITH '<?xml version="1.0"?><table><tr><td><img src="pix/logo-tl.gif"></img></td></tr></table>' AS xmlString
RETURN apoc.xml.parse(xmlString) AS value
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
| value
| {_type: "table", _children: [{_type: "tr", _children: [{_type: "td", _children: [{_type: "img", src: "pix/logo-tl.gif"}]}]}]}
|===

[[load-xml-available-procedures-apoc.import.xml]]
=== `apoc.import.xml`

If we don't want to do any transformation of the XML before creating a graph structure, we can create a 1:1 mapping of XML into the graph using the `apoc.import.xml` procedure.

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="1m"]
|===
include::example$generated-documentation/apoc.import.xml-lite.csv[]
|===

This procedure will return a node representing the XML document containing nodes and relationships underneath mapping to the XML structure.

The following mapping rules are applied:

[options="header"]
|===
| xml | label | properties
| document | XmlDocument | _xmlVersion, _xmlEncoding
| processing instruction | XmlProcessingInstruction | _piData, _piTarget
| Element/Tag | XmlTag | _name
| Attribute | n/a | property in the XmlTag node
| Text | XmlWord | for each word a separate node is created
|===

The nodes for the XML document are connected:

[options="header"]
|===
| relationship type | description
| :IS_CHILD_OF | pointing to a nested xml element
| :FIRST_CHILD_OF | pointing to the first child
| :NEXT_SIBLING | pointing to the next xml element on the same nesting level
| :NEXT | produces a linear chain through the full document
| :NEXT_WORD | only produced if config map has `createNextWordRelationships:true`. Connects words in XML to a text flow.
|===

This procedure supports the following config parameters:

.Config
[options="header"]
|===
| config option | default value | description
| connectCharacters | false | if `true` the xml text elements are child nodes of their tags, interconnected by relationships of type `relType` (see below)
| filterLeadingWhitespace | false |  if `true` leading whitespace is skipped for each line
| delimiter | `\s` (regex whitespace) | if given, split text elements with the delimiter into separate nodes
| label | XmlCharacter | label to use for text element representation
| relType | `NE` | relationship type to be used for connecting the text elements into one linked list
| charactersForTag | {} | map of tagname -> string. For the given tag names an additional text element is added containing the value as `text` property. Useful e.g. for `<lb/>` tags in TEI-XML to be represented as `<lb> </lb>`.

[[load-xml-examples-local-file]]
=== Import from local file

The `books.xml` file described below contains the first two books from the Microsoft Books XML file.
We'll use the smaller file in this section to simplify our examples.

.books.xml

We'll place this file into the `import` directory of our Neo4j instance.
Let's now write a query using the `apoc.load.xml` procedure to explore this file.

.The following query processes `books.xml` and returns the content as Cypher data structures
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml("file:///books.xml")
YIELD value
RETURN value

|===

We get back a map representing the XML structure.
Every time an XML element is nested inside another one, it is accessible via the `.children` property.
We can write the following query to get a better understanding of what our file contains.

.The following query processes `book.xml` and parses the results to pull out the title, description, genre, and authors
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml("file:///books.xml")
YIELD value
UNWIND value._children AS book
RETURN book.id AS bookId,
       [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "title"][0] AS title,
       [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "description"][0] AS description,
       [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "author"] AS authors,
       [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "genre"][0] AS genre;

|===

Let's now create a graph of books and their metadata, authors, and genres.

.The following query processes `book.xml` and parses the results to pull out the title, description, genre, and authors
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml("file:///books.xml")
YIELD value
UNWIND value._children AS book

WITH book.id AS bookId,
     [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "title"][0] AS title,
     [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "description"][0] AS description,
     [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "author"] AS authors,
     [item in book._children WHERE item._type = "genre"][0] AS genre

MERGE (b:Book {id: bookId})
SET b.title = title._text, b.description = description._text

MERGE (g:Genre {name: genre._text})
MERGE (b)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g)

WITH b, authors
UNWIND authors AS author
MERGE (a:Author {name:author._text})
MERGE (a)-[:WROTE]->(b);
----

The Neo4j Browser visualization below shows the imported graph:

image::apoc.load.xml.local.books.svg[]


You can use `failOnError` configuration to handle the result in case of incorrect url or xml.
For example, with the help of the `apoc.when` procedure, you can return `nothingToDo` as result with incorrect url:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml("MY_XML_URL", '', {failOnError:false})
YIELD value
WITH value as valueXml
call apoc.do.when(valueXml["_type"] is null, "return 'nothingToDo' as result", "return valueXml as result", {valueXml: valueXml})
YIELD value
UNWIND value["result"] as result
RETURN result
----


[[load-xml-examples-simple-xml-format]]
=== Import from GitHub

We can also process XML files from HTTP or HTTPS URIs.
Let's start by processing the `books.xml` file hosted on GitHub.

This time we'll pass in `true` as the 4th argument of the procedure.
This means that the XML will be parsed in simple mode.

.The following query loads the books.xml file from GitHub using simple mode
[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
WITH "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml" AS uri

We again get back back a map representing the XML structure, but the structure is different than when we don't use simple mode.
This time nested XML elements are accessible via a property of the element name prefixed with an `_`.

We can write the following query to get a better understanding of what our file contains.

Rather than just returning that data, we can create a graph of books and their metadata, authors, and genres.

.The following query processes `book.xml` and parses the results to pull out the title, description, genre, and authors
[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/4.0/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml" AS uri
CALL apoc.load.xml(uri, '', {}, true)
YIELD value
UNWIND value._catalog AS catalog
WITH catalog.id AS bookId,
       [item in catalog._book WHERE item._type = "title"][0] AS title,
       [item in catalog._book WHERE item._type = "description"][0] AS description,
       [item in catalog._book WHERE item._type = "author"] AS authors,
       [item in catalog._book WHERE item._type = "genre"][0] AS genre

MERGE (b:Book {id: bookId})
SET b.title = title._text, b.description = description._text

MERGE (g:Genre {name: genre._text})
MERGE (b)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g)

WITH b, authors
UNWIND authors AS author
MERGE (a:Author {name:author._text})
MERGE (a)-[:WROTE]->(b);
----

The Neo4j Browser visualization below shows the imported graph:

[[load-xml-examples-xpath]]
=== xPath expressions

We can also provide an xPath expression to select nodes from an XML document.
If we only want to return books that have the `Computer` genre, we could write the following query:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml",
  '/catalog/book[genre=\"Computer\"]'
)
YIELD value as book
WITH book.id as id, [attr IN book._children WHERE attr._type IN ['title','price'] | attr._text] as pairs
RETURN id, pairs[0] as title, pairs[1] as price;
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
| id      | title                                    | price
| "bk101" | "XML Developer's Guide"                  | "44.95"
| "bk110" | "Microsoft .NET: The Programming Bible"  | "36.95"
| "bk111" | "MSXML3: A Comprehensive Guide"          | "36.95"
| "bk112" | "Visual Studio 7: A Comprehensive Guide" | "49.95"
|===

In this case we return only `id`, `title` and `prize` but we can return any other elements

We can also return just a single specific element.
For example, the following query returns the `author` of the book with `id = bg102`

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CALL apoc.load.xml(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml',
  '/catalog/book[@id="bk102"]/author'
)
YIELD value as result
WITH result._text as author
RETURN author;
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
| author
| "Ralls, Kim"
|===

[[load-xml-examples-extracting-datastructures]]
=== Extracting data structures

We can turn values into a map using the `apoc.map.fromPairs` function.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call apoc.load.xml("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml")
yield value as catalog
UNWIND catalog._children as book
WITH book.id as id, [attr IN book._children WHERE attr._type IN ['author','title'] | [attr._type, attr._text]] as pairs
WITH id, apoc.map.fromPairs(pairs) AS value
RETURN id, value
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| id | value
| "bk101" | {title: "XML Developer's Guide", author: "Arciniegas, Fabio"}
| "bk102" | {title: "Midnight Rain", author: "Ralls, Kim"}
| "bk103" | {title: "Maeve Ascendant", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk104" | {title: "Oberon's Legacy", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk105" | {title: "The Sundered Grail", author: "Corets, Eva"}
| "bk106" | {title: "Lover Birds", author: "Randall, Cynthia"}
| "bk107" | {title: "Splish Splash", author: "Thurman, Paula"}
| "bk108" | {title: "Creepy Crawlies", author: "Knorr, Stefan"}
| "bk109" | {title: "Paradox Lost", author: "Kress, Peter"}
| "bk110" | {title: "Microsoft .NET: The Programming Bible", author: "O'Brien, Tim"}
| "bk111" | {title: "MSXML3: A Comprehensive Guide", author: "O'Brien, Tim"}
| "bk112" | {title: "Visual Studio 7: A Comprehensive Guide", author: "Galos, Mike"}
|===

And now we can cleanly access the attributes from the map.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call apoc.load.xml("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/{branch}/src/test/resources/xml/books.xml")
yield value as catalog
UNWIND catalog._children as book
WITH book.id as id, [attr IN book._children WHERE attr._type IN ['author','title'] | [attr._type, attr._text]] as pairs
WITH id, apoc.map.fromPairs(pairs) AS value
RETURN id, value.title, value.author
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| id      | value.title                              | value.author
| "bk101" | "XML Developer's Guide"                  | "Arciniegas, Fabio"
| "bk102" | "Midnight Rain"                          | "Ralls, Kim"
| "bk103" | "Maeve Ascendant"                        | "Corets, Eva"

| "bk105" | "The Sundered Grail"                     | "Corets, Eva"
| "bk106" | "Lover Birds"                            | "Randall, Cynthia"
| "bk107" | "Splish Splash"                          | "Thurman, Paula"
