:description: This section describes centrality algorithms in the APOC library.



These algorithms have been deprecated by the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[Graph Data Science Library^], which has more performant and battle hardened versions of the algorithms.

For documentation of the Centrality algorithms, see https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/centrality/
