[NOTE]
====
This procedure is not considered safe to run from multiple threads.
It is therefore not supported by the parallel runtime (introduced in Neo4j 5.13).

.Details
|===
| *Syntax* 3+| `apoc.export.arrow.graph(file, graph [, config ]) :: (file, source, format, nodes, relationships, properties, time, rows, batchSize, batches, done, data)`
| *Description* 3+| Exports the given graph as an arrow file.
.4+| *Input arguments* | *Name* | *Type* | *Description*
| `file` | `STRING` | The name of the file to export the data to.
| `graph` | `ANY` | The graph to export.
| `config` | `MAP` | `{ batchSize = 2000 :: INTEGER }`. The default is: `{}`.
.13+| *Return arguments* | *Name* | *Type* | *Description*
| `file` | `STRING` | The name of the file to which the data was exported.
| `source` | `STRING` | A summary of the exported data.
| `format` | `STRING` | The format the file is exported in.
| `nodes` | `INTEGER` | The number of exported nodes.
| `relationships` | `INTEGER` | The number of exported relationships.
| `properties` | `INTEGER` | The number of exported properties.
| `time` | `INTEGER` | The duration of the export.
| `rows` | `INTEGER` | The number of rows returned.
| `batchSize` | `INTEGER` | The size of the batches the export was run in.
| `batches` | `INTEGER` | The number of batches the export was run in.
| `done` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the export ran successfully.
| `data` | `ANY` | The data returned by the export.

== Usage Examples
The procedure expose an Arrow file of rows with the following structure
- `<id>`: for node id
- `<labels>`: list of labels
- `<source.id>`: source node id (in case of relationship)
- `<target.id>`: target node id (in case of relationship)
- `<type>`: for relationship type
- the list of properties of nodes and relationships flattened as table

So for the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.graph.fromDB('neo4j',{}) yield graph
CALL apoc.export.arrow.graph('my_file.arrow', graph) YIELD file, source, format,
    nodes, relationships, properties,
    time, rows, batchSize,
    batches, done, data
----

We'll have an arrow file with the following columns:

- `<id>`
- `<labels>`
- `<source.id>`
- `<target.id>`
- `<type>`
- `name`
- `age`
- `male`
- `kids`
- `born`
- `place`
- `since`
- `bffSince`
