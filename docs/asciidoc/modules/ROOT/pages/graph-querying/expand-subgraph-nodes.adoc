= Expand to nodes in a subgraph
:description: This section describes a procedure that expands a subgraph from a set of start nodes, and returns all nodes within the subgraph.



This procedure expands to subgraph nodes reachable from the start node following relationships to max-level adhering to the label filters.
It allows fine grained control over the traversals that expand the subgraph.

== Configuration parameters

The procedures support the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| minLevel | Long | -1 | the minimum number of hops in the traversal. Must be 0 or 1 if specified
| maxLevel | Long | -1 | the maximum number of hops in the traversal
| relationshipFilter | String | null | the relationship types and directions to traverse.

See <<expand-subgraph-nodes-relationship-filters>>.
| labelFilter | String | null | the node labels to traverse.

See <<expand-subgraph-nodes-label-filters>>.
| beginSequenceAtStart | Boolean | true | starts matching sequences of node labels and/or relationship types (defined in `relationshipFilter`, `labelFilter`, or `sequences`) one node away from the start node.
| bfs | Boolean | true | use Breadth First Search when traversing. Uses Depth First Search if set to `false`
| filterStartNode | Boolean | false | whether the `labelFilter` and `sequence` apply to the start node of the expansion.
| limit | Long | -1 | limit the number of paths returned. When using `bfs:true`, this has the effect of returning paths to the `n` nearest nodes with labels in the termination or end node filter, where `n` is the limit given.
If set to `true`, a `null` value is yielded whenever the expansion would normally eliminate rows due to no results.
| endNodes | List<Node> | null | only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion will continue past these nodes, if possible.
| terminatorNodes | List<Node> | null | Only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion won't continue past these nodes.
| whitelistNodes | List<Node> | null | Only these nodes are allowed in the expansion (though endNodes and terminatorNodes will also be allowed, if present).
| blacklistNodes | List<Node> | null | None of the paths returned will include these nodes.
|===

It also has the following fixed parameter:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| uniqueness | String | NODE_GLOBAL | the strategy to use when expanding relationships in a traversal.
`NODE_GLOBAL` means that a node cannot be traversed more than once.
This is what the legacy traversal framework does.

[[expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-label-relationship-filters]]
=== Relationship Type and Node Label filters

Let's start by expanding paths from the Praveena node.
We only want to consider the `KNOWS` relationship type, so we'll specify that as the `relationshipFilter` parameter.

.The following returns the people reachable by the `KNOWS` relationship at 1 to 2 hops from Praveena
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Praveena"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
	relationshipFilter: "KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 2
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Zhen"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Martin"})
| (:Person:DevRel {name: "Lju"})
| (:Person:Field {name: "Stefan"})
|===

4 people are reachable from Praveena.

We can also provide a node label filter to restrict the nodes that are returned.
If we want to only return paths where every node has the `Engineering` label, we'll provide the value `+Engineering` to the `labelFilter` parameter.

.The following returns the `Engineering` people reachable by the `KNOWS` relationship at 1 to 2 hops from Praveena
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Praveena"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
	relationshipFilter: "KNOWS",
	labelFilter: "+Engineering",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 2
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Zhen"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Martin"})
|===

We lose Lju and Stefan because those nodes don't have the `Engineering` label.

We can specify multiple relationship types.
The following query starts from the Alicia node, and then expands the `FOLLOWS` and `KNOWS` relationships:

[[expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-label-relationship-filters-alicia-all]]
.The following returns the people reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationships at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Sales {name: "Jonny"})
| (:Person:Field {name: "Joe"})
| (:Person:Product {name: "Jake"})
| (:Person:Sales {name: "Anthony"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Praveena"})
| (:Person:DevRel {name: "Mark"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Zhen"})
| (:Person:Field {name: "Stefan"})
| (:Person:Product {name: "John"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Martin"})
| (:Person:DevRel {name: "Lju"})
|===

This list includes all but one of the people in our graph, which means that Alicia is very well connected.

We can also specify traversal termination criteria using label filters.
If we wanted to terminate a traversal as soon as the traversal encounters a node containing the `Engineering` label, we can use the `/Engineering` node filter.

.The following returns the people reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationships at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia, terminating as soon as a node with the `Engineering` label is reached
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    labelFilter: "/Engineering",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Zhen"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Praveena"})
|===

We're now down to only 2 people - Zhen and Praveena.
But this query doesn't capture all of the paths from Alicia that end in a node with the `Engineering` label.
We can use the `>Engineering` node filter to define a traversal that:

* only returns nodes that have the `Engineering` label
* continues expansion to end nodes after that, looking for more nodes that have the `Engineering` label

.The following returns `Engineering` people reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationships at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    labelFilter: ">Engineering",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Zhen"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Praveena"})
| (:Person:Engineering {name: "Martin"})
|===

Our query now also returns Martin, who must have been reachable via either Zhen or Praveena.

[[expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-end-nodes-terminator-nodes]]
=== Terminator Nodes and End Nodes

As well as specifying terminator and end labels for traversals, we can also specify terminator and end nodes.
For this procedure, these parameters both behave the same way - the procedure will determine whether any of the nodes provided as terminator or end nodes are reachable from the start node.

Let's build on the previous query that found people that Alicia `KNOWS` or `FOLLOWS`.
We want to know whether there's a way to get from Alicia to Joe, which we can do by passing the Joe node to the `terminatorNodes` parameter.

.The following returns the terminator nodes reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationships at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
MATCH (joe:Person {name: "Joe"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3,
    terminatorNodes: [joe]
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Field {name: "Joe"})
|===

We do indeed have a path from Alicia to Joe.

And we know from <<expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-label-relationship-filters-alicia-all, an earlier example>> that Alicia can actually reach all other nodes in the graph using the `KNOWS` or `FOLLOWS` relationships.
But what if we want to determine whether Mark, Joe, Zhen, and Praveena are reachable using only the `KNOWS` relationship?

.The following returns the end nodes reachable by the `KNOWS` relationships at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
MATCH (end:Person)
WHERE end.name IN ["Mark", "Joe", "Zhen", "Praveena"]
WITH p, collect(end) AS endNodes
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3,
    endNodes: endNodes
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:DevRel {name: "Mark"})
|===

Only Mark is reachable!

[[expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-whitelist-blacklist]]
=== Whitelist Nodes and Blacklist Nodes

Whitelist and blacklist nodes can also be specified.

Let's build on the query that found people that Alicia `KNOWS` or `FOLLOWS`.
We want to find the nodes reachable via paths that only include Jonny, Mark, or Zhen.
We can do this by passing those odes to the parameter `whitelistNodes`.

.The following returns nodes reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationship types at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia, where the paths to those nodes must only include Mark, Jonny, or Zhen
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
MATCH (whitelist:Person)
WHERE whitelist.name IN ["Jonny", "Mark", "Zhen"]
WITH p, collect(whitelist) AS whitelistNodes
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3,
    whitelistNodes: whitelistNodes
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Sales {name: "Jonny"})
|===

Only Jonny can be reached.
We can therefore infer that Mark and Zhen are only reachable via another node that wasn't include in the whitelist.

A blacklist is used to exclude nodes from the paths that lead to reachable nodes.
If we want to return nodes that are reachable without going through Joe, we can do this by passing the Joe node to the `blacklistNodes` parameter.

.The following returns nodes reachable by the `FOLLOWS` or `KNOWS` relationship types at 1 to 3 hops from Alicia, where the paths to those nodes do not go through Joe
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alicia"})
MATCH (joe:Person {name: "Joe"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
    relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>|KNOWS",
    minLevel: 1,
    maxLevel: 3,
    blacklistNodes: [joe]
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node
| (:Person:Sales {name: "Jonny"})
| (:Person:Product {name: "Jake"})
| (:Person:Sales {name: "Anthony"})
| (:Person:DevRel {name: "Mark"})
| (:Person:Field {name: "Stefan"})
|===

Only 5 nodes are reachable without going through the Joe node.
If we remember back to <<expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-label-relationship-filters-alicia-all, an earlier example>>, 11 nodes were reachable when we didn't specify a blacklist.
This indicates that Joe is an important connector in this graph.


[[expand-subgraph-nodes-examples-sequence-rel-types]]
=== Sequences of relationship types

Sequences of relationship types can be specified by comma separating the values passed to `relationshipFilter`.

For example, if we want to start from the Joe node and traverse a sequence of the `FOLLOWS` relationship in the outgoing direction and the `KNOWS` relationship in either direction, we can specify the relationship filter `FOLLOWS>,KNOWS`.

.The following returns the reachable nodes by following the `FOLLOWS` and `KNOWS` relationship types alternately from Joe
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Joe"})
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(p, {
	relationshipFilter: "FOLLOWS>,KNOWS",
	beginSequenceAtStart: true,
	minLevel: 1,
	maxLevel: 4
})
YIELD node
RETURN node;
----
