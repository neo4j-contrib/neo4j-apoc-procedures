:description: This section contains instructions for installing the APOC standard library.



_APOC Core_ is packaged with Neo4j and can be found in the `$NEO4J_HOME/labs` directory.
_APOC Full_ can be downloaded using one of the methods described in the sections below.

[WARNING]

_APOC Full_ contains all the procedures and functions included in _APOC Core_.

== APOC Core

_APOC Core_ can be installed by moving the APOC jar file from the `$NEO4J_HOME/labs` directory to the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory and restarting Neo4j.

After you move the jar file to the plugins folder you have to restart neo4j with `neo4j restart`

// tag::version-matrix[]
Since APOC relies on Neo4j's internal APIs, you need to use the right APOC version for your Neo4j installation.

APOC uses a consistent versioning scheme: `<neo4j-version>.<apoc>` version.
The trailing `<apoc>` part of the version number will be incremented with every apoc release.

The version compatibility matrix explains the mapping between Neo4j and APOC versions:
