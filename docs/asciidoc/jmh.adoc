= Usage of JMH in apoc

The APOC library uses http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[JMH] for micro benchmarking. You'll find the
source code for the benchmarks in
src/jmh/main. We use the https://github.com/melix/jmh-gradle-plugin[Gradle JMH plugin] to configure JMH and run the
benchmarks.

NOTE: JMH is *not* run during a regular build.

To run JMH benchmarks, type `./gradlew jmh`
