# list of removed functions and procedures for 4.0

All freetext/fulltext stuff has been removed in favour of 3.5+ productized fulltext indexes.

## procedures

apoc.index.relatedNodes (index feature ootb)
apoc.index.orderedRange (index feature ootb)

apoc.algo.* (use separate graph algo apackage instead)

apoc.static.get (proc deleted, function exists)
apoc.static.getAll (proc deleted, function exists)

apoc.monitor.locks() (proc deleted, cannot get information via api)


## functions



## changed behaviour

* apoc.agg.statistics on an empty list returns `null` for `min` and `max`. Used to be `0` previously

* all apoc* configuration option needs to be moved to `apoc.conf`
** `apoc.initializer.cypher`
** *apoc.initializer.cypher.<anything>`


** mongo calls use `compatibleValue:true` by default. Reason: 4.0 doesn't support java.util.Date as nested value in a map returned from a procedures.
Side effect: date values are returned as millis since epoc.


## changes done 3.5 -> 4.0

NOTE: the following list is incomplete

* Neo4j config does no longer allow adhoc dynamic settings - which apoc uses a lot. Therefore APOC 4.0 uses it's own `apoc.conf`, see `ApocConfig.java`.
* moving global core API actions from `GraphDatabaseService` to `Transaction` - e.g. `tx.createNode(...)`
* removal of graph properties. UUIDHandler, CypherProcedures and Triggers used them in APOC. Instead APOC 4.0 uses `systemdb`, e.g. we maintain a separate node for each trigger: `CREATE (n:ApocTrigger{database: <dbname>}, ...)`
* refactoring lots of `static` datastructure in APOC into `LifeCycles`, so they can exist on a per-database level
* all calls to AlgoFactory require now a `ExecutionContext` (aka db + tx)
* `TransactionTemplate` has been removed from Neo4j
* `org.neo4j.cypher.export.SubGraphExporter` et.al have been removed in Neo4j -> we add the latest version of the sources to apoc

* using `ImpermanentDatabaseRule` instead of `TestGraphDatabaseFactory...`
* `ImpermanentDatabaseRule.withSetting()` takes now typed values instead of strings
* curly braces syntax for Cypher parameters no longer supported : `$param` instead of `{param}`
* cypher's `length` functions doesn't work on strings any longer. use `size` instead
* `TransactionEventHandler` renamed to `TransactionListener`
* `TransactionListener.beforeCommit` gets an additional parameter `Transaction`
* `apoc.periodic.iterate` might return different error messages.

* on API level a `IndexDefinition` could have multiple labels. Apoc's `Schema` should reflect that - to be discussed.
* nodes/rels acquired in one tx need to be rebound when used in another tx `tx.getNodeByid(node.getId())`

## todos

* make test (esp. for export functions) independent of internal node ids.
